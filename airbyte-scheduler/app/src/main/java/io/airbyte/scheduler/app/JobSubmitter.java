  /**
   * Since job submission and job execution happen in two separate thread pools, and job execution is
   * what removes a job from the submission queue, it is possible for a job to be submitted multiple
   * times.
   *
   * This synchronised block guarantees only a single thread can utilise the concurrent set to decide
   * whether a job should be submitted. This job id is added here, and removed in the finish block of
   * {@link #submitJob(Job)}.
   *
   * Since {@link JobPersistence#getNextJob()} returns the next queued job, this solution cause
   * head-of-line blocking as the JobSubmitter tries to submit the same job. However, this suggests
   * the Worker Pool needs more workers and is inevitable when dealing with pending jobs.
   *
   * See https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/4378 for more info.
