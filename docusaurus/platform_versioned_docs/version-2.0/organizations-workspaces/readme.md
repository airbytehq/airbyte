# Organizations and workspaces

Organizations and workspaces are the highest levels of structure in Airbyte. They're the primary ways you segregate data and connections, manage access, and control billing.

If you use Core, you only have one organization and one workspace, so these concepts aren't relevant to you. If you use Cloud Standard, each organization is limited to one workspace. You can upgrade to Pro or Enterprise Flex to access multiple workspaces per organization.
