# Role-based access control (RBAC)

Role Based Access Control allows a user with Administrative access to apply roles to users, granting different levels of permission within an organization or workspace.

:::info
**Self-Managed Enterprise** instances have an `Instance Admin` role in addition to the other roles outlined in this document. The first user who logs on to Airbyte in a Self-Managed Enterprise instance will be assigned this role. This user will have all permissions listed below for all workspaces and all organizations associated with their Enterprise account. To update this assignment, enterprise customers should contact [Airbyte support](https://support.airbyte.com/hc/en-us).

## Organization roles

When you assign an organization role, Airbyte scopes permissions to the entire organization, which includes all workspaces in that organization.

## Workspace roles

In a workspace role, Airbyte scopes permissions to that specific workspace. You can override an organization role by assigning someone a higher role in a workspace. However, you can't assign a role that's more restricted than the role that person holds in the organization. For example, an organization admin must also be a workspace admin. However, an organization reader can be a workspace reader, editor, or admin.

## Best practices for assigning roles

- At the organization level, assign the lowest level of permission necessary.
- At the workspace level, assign higher roles for individual workspaces as needed to override organization role within that workspace.
- Don't assign admin roles frivolously. Once someone is an admin, you can't demote them.
