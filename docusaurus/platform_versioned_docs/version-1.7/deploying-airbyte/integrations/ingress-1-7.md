# Update ingress for version 1.7

Airbyte version 1.7 introduced a breaking change for ingress to the Connector Builder. If you're a Self-Managed Community user or Self-Managed Enterprise customer, and you're upgrading to version 1.7.0 or later, complete these steps when you upgrade. If you don't, the Connector Builder gives you 403 Forbidden errors and you can't test streams or use the Connector Builder UI.

## What changed

In version 1.7, Airbyte removed the `webapp` service, merging its functions into `server`. When you deployed Airbyte, you probably set up ingress to expect that `webapp` would exist and function as a proxy.

Update your rules to reflect that it no longer exists. How you do this depends if you deploy Airbyte with Helm or abctl.

## Deploying with Helm

Update ingress rules on your deployment to handle `airbyte-server-svc` and `airbyte-connector-builder-server-svc`. Once you do this, the Connector Builder functions normally again.

Review the following examples and use them as a guide to update your own ingress settings.

## Deploying with abctl

If you deploy Airbyte with abctl, abctl handles ingress for you. abctl version 0.28 and later support the changes in Airbyte 1.7.

1. Upgrade abctl to the latest version. For example, `brew upgrade abctl`.

2. Deploy the latest version of Airbyte. For example, `abctl local install`.
