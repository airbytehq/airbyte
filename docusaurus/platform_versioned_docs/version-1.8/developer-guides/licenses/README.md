# Licenses

Airbyte monorepo uses Elastic License 2.0

If you have any question regarding licenses, just visit our [FAQ](license-faq.md) or [contact us](mailto:license@airbyte.io).

If you want to see a list of examples supported by ELv2, and not, to have a better understanding whether you should be concerned or not, check the [examples](examples.md).

**TL;DR:** Unless you want to host Airbyte yourself and sell it as an ELT/ETL tool, or to sell a product that directly exposes Airbyteâ€™s UI or API, you should be good to go!
