            \ operators  with keywords. - Phrase Search Operator: This operator allows\
            \ you to make an exact search. Keywords surrounded by \n  quotation marks\
            \ are used to search for articles with the exact same keyword\nsequence.\
            \ \n  For example the query: \"Apple iPhone\" will return articles matching\
            \ at\nleast once this sequence of keywords. - Logical AND Operator: This\
            \ operator allows you to make sure that several keywords are all used\
            \ in the article\n  search. By default the space character acts as an\
            \ AND operator, it is\npossible to replace the space character \n  by\
            \ AND to obtain the same result. For example the query: Apple Microsoft\n\
            is equivalent to Apple AND Microsoft - Logical OR Operator: This operator\
            \ allows you to retrieve articles matching the keyword a or the keyword\
            \ b.\n  It is important to note that this operator has a higher precedence\
            \ than\nthe AND operator. For example the \n  query: Apple OR Microsoft\
            \ will return all articles matching the keyword\nApple as well as all\
            \ articles matching \n  the keyword Microsoft\n- Logical NOT Operator:\
            \ This operator allows you to remove from the results the articles corresponding\
            \ to the\n  specified keywords. To use it, you need to add NOT in front\
            \ of each word\nor phrase surrounded by quotes.\n  For example the query:\
            \ Apple NOT iPhone will return all articles matching\nthe keyword Apple\
