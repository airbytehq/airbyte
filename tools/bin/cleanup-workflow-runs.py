'''

This script is intended to be run in conjuction with identify-dormant-workflows.py to keep GH actions clean.

The basic workflow is 

identify-dormant-workflows.py notifies of dormant workflows (workflows that have no runs newer than DAYS_TO_KEEP_ORPHANED_JOBS days) daily -> 
manually notifies infra team via slack ->
infra team checks with stakeholders to ensure dormant jobs can be deleted and then cleans up workflow runs manually ->
cleanup-workflows.py deletes old workflow runs (again older than DAYS_TO_KEEP_ORPHANED_JOBS) that have no associated workflow

We need to clean up the runs because even if a workflow is deleted, the runs linger in the UI. 
We don't want to delete workflow runs newer than 90 days on GH actions, even if the workflow doesn't exist.
it's possible that people might test things off the master branch and we don't want to delete their recent runs
