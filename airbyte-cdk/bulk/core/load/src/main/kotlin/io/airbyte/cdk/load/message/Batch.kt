/**
 * Represents an accumulated batch of records in some stage of processing.
 *
 * Emitted by @[io.airbyte.cdk.write.StreamLoader.processRecords] to describe the batch accumulated.
 * Non-[State.COMPLETE] batches are routed to @[io.airbyte.cdk.write.StreamLoader.processBatch]
 * re-entrantly until completion.
 *
 * The framework will track the association between the Batch and the range of records it
 * represents, by [Batch.State]s. The [State.PERSISTED] state has special meaning: it indicates that
 * the associated ranges have been persisted remotely, and that platform checkpoint messages can be
 * emitted.
 *
 * [State.LOCAL] is used internally to indicate that records have been spooled to disk for
 * processing and should not be used by implementors.
 *
 * When a stream has been read to End-of-stream, and all ranges between 0 and End-of-stream are
 * [State.COMPLETE], then all records are considered to have been processed.
 *
 * A [Batch] may contain an optional `groupId`. If provided, the most advanced state provided for
 * any batch will apply to all batches with the same `groupId`. This is useful for a case where each
 * batch represents part of a larger work unit that is only completed when all parts are processed.
 * (We used most advanced instead of latest to avoid race conditions.)
 *
 * The intended usage for implementors is to implement the provided interfaces in case classes that
 * contain the necessary metadata for processing, using them in @
 * [io.airbyte.cdk.write.StreamLoader.processBatch] to route to the appropriate handler(s).
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * sealed class MyBatch: Batch
 * data class MyLocalFile(
 *   override val path: Path,
 *   override val totalSizeBytes: Long
 * ): StagedLocalFile
 * data class MyRemoteObject(
 *   override val key: String
 * ): RemoteObject
 * // etc...
 * ```
