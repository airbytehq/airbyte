/**
 * Represents the state of a batch of records as it moves through processing. These are generic
 * stages for bookkeeping, which CDK interface devs can assign to processing stages as they see fit.
 * The only significant values are
 * - [BatchState.PERSISTED] Records will be considered recoverably persisted and checkpoints will be
 * acked to the orchestrator.
 * - [BatchState.COMPLETE] All per-batch processing is done. (Post-processing may still occur during
 * close-of-stream). Records are considered PERSISTED (ie, will be acked if not already). If all
 * records are COMPLETE, and end-of-stream has been read, the stream will be considered complete and
 * will be closed.
 * - All other values are for bookkeeping convenience only.
