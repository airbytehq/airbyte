/**
 * An S3MultipartUpload that provides an [OutputStream] abstraction for writing data. This should
 * never be created directly, but used indirectly through [S3Client.streamingUpload].
 *
 * NOTE: The OutputStream interface does not support suspending functions, but the kotlin s3 SDK
 * does. To stitch them together, we could use `runBlocking`, but that would risk blocking the
 * thread (and defeating the purpose of using the kotlin sdk). In order to avoid this, we use a
 * [Channel] to queue up work and process it a coroutine, launched asynchronously in the same
 * context. The work will be coherent as long as the calls to the interface are made synchronously
 * (which would be the case without coroutines).
