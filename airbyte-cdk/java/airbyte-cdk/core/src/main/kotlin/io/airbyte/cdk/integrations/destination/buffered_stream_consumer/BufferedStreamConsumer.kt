/**
 * This class consumes AirbyteMessages from the worker.
 *
 * Record Messages: It adds record messages to a buffer. Under 2 conditions, it will flush the
 * records in the buffer to a temporary table in the destination. Condition 1: The buffer fills up
 * (the buffer is designed to be small enough as not to exceed the memory of the container).
 * Condition 2: On close.
 *
 * State Messages: This consumer tracks the last state message it has accepted. It also tracks the
 * last state message that was committed to the temporary table. For now, we only emit a message if
 * everything is successful. Once checkpointing is turned on, we will emit the state message as long
 * as the onClose successfully commits any messages to the raw table.
 *
 * All other message types are ignored.
 *
 * Throughout the lifecycle of the consumer, messages get promoted from buffered to flushed to
 * committed. A record message when it is received is immediately buffered. When the buffer fills
 * up, all buffered records are flushed out of memory using the user-provided recordBuffer. When
 * this flush happens, a state message is moved from pending to flushed. On close, if the
 * user-provided onClose function is successful, then the flushed state record is considered
 * committed and is then emitted. We expect this class to only ever emit either 1 state message (in
 * the case of a full or partial success) or 0 state messages (in the case where the onClose step
 * was never reached or did not complete without exception).
 *
 * When a record is "flushed" it is moved from the docker container to the destination. By
 * convention, it is usually placed in some sort of temporary storage on the destination (e.g. a
 * temporary database or file store). The logic in close handles committing the temporary
 * representation data to the final store (e.g. final table). In the case of staging destinations
 * they often have additional temporary stores. The common pattern for staging destination is that
 * flush pushes the data into a staging area in cloud storage and then close copies from staging to
 * a temporary table AND then copies from the temporary table into the final table. This abstraction
 * is blind to the detail of how staging destinations implement their close.
