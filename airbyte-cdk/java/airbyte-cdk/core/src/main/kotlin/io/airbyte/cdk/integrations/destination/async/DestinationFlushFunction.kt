/**
 * An interface meant to be used with [FlushWorkers].
 *
 * A destination instructs workers how to write data by specifying [.flush]. This keeps the worker
 * abstraction generic and reusable.
 *
 * e.g. A database destination's flush function likely involves parsing the stream into SQL
 * statements.
 *
 * There are 2 different destination types as of this writing:
 *
 * * 1. Destinations that upload files. This includes warehouses and databases.
 * * 2. Destinations that upload data streams. This mostly includes various Cloud storages. This
 * will include reverse-ETL in the future
 *
 * In both cases, the simplest way to model the incoming data is as a stream.
