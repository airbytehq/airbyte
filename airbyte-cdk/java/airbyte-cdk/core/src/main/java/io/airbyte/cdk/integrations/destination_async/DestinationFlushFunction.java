 * An interface meant to be used with {@link FlushWorkers}.

 * <p>
 * e.g. A database destination's flush function likely involves parsing the stream into SQL
 * statements.
 * <p>
 * There are 2 different destination types as of this writing:
 * <ul>
 * <li>1. Destinations that upload files. This includes warehouses and databases.</li>
 * <li>2. Destinations that upload data streams. This mostly includes various Cloud storages. This
 * will include reverse-ETL in the future</li>
 * </ul>
 * In both cases, the simplest way to model the incoming data is as a stream.
