        Set the initial state for the cursors.

        This method initializes the state for each partition cursor using the provided stream state.
        If a partition state is provided in the stream state, it will update the corresponding partition cursor with this state.

        To simplify processing and state management, we do not maintain the checkpointed state of the parent partitions.
        Instead, we are tracking whether a parent has already successfully synced on a prior attempt and skipping over it
        allowing the sync to continue making progress. And this works for RFR because the platform will dispose of this
        state on the next sync job.
