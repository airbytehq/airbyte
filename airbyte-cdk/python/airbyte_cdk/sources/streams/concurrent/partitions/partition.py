        Note: it would have been interesting to have a type of `Mapping[str, Comparable]` to simplify typing but some slices can have nested
         values ([example](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/1ce84d6396e446e1ac2377362446e3fb94509461/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-stripe/source_stripe/streams.py#L584-L596))
