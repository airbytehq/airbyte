class RemoveFields(RecordTransformation):
    """
    A transformation which removes fields from a record. The fields removed are designated using FieldPointers.
    During transformation, if a field or any of its parents does not exist in the record, no error is thrown.

    If an input field pointer references an item in a list (e.g: ["k", 0] in the object {"k": ["a", "b", "c"]}) then
    the object at that index is set to None rather than being not entirely removed from the list. TODO change this behavior.

    It's possible to remove objects nested in lists e.g: removing [".", 0, "k"] from {".": [{"k": "V"}]} results in {".": [{}]}

    Usage syntax:

    ```yaml
        my_stream:
            <other parameters..>
            transformations:
                - type: RemoveFields
                  field_pointers:
                    - ["path", "to", "field1"]
                    - ["path2"]
    ```
