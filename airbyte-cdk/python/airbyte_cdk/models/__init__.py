# The earlier versions of airbyte-cdk (0.28.0<=) had the airbyte_protocol python classes
# declared inline in the airbyte-cdk code. However, somewhere around Feb 2023 the
# Airbyte Protocol moved to its own repo/PyPi package, called airbyte-protocol-models.
# This directory including the airbyte_protocol.py and well_known_types.py files
# are just wrappers on top of that stand-alone package which do some namespacing magic
# to make the airbyte_protocol python classes available to the airbyte-cdk consumer as part
# of airbyte-cdk rather than a standalone package.
