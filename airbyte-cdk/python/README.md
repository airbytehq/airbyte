# Connector Development Kit \(Python\)

The Airbyte Python CDK is a framework for rapidly developing production-grade Airbyte connectors. The CDK currently offers helpers specific for creating Airbyte source connectors for:

* HTTP APIs \(REST APIs, GraphQL, etc..\)
* Singer Taps
* Generic Python sources \(anything not covered by the above\)

The CDK provides an improved developer experience by providing basic implementation structure and abstracting away low-level glue boilerplate.

This document is a general introduction to the CDK. Readers should have basic familiarity with the [Airbyte Specification](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol/) before proceeding.

## Getting Started

Generate an empty connector using the code generator. First clone the Airbyte repository then from the repository root run

```text
cd airbyte-integrations/connector-templates/generator
./generate.sh
```

then follow the interactive prompt. Next, find all `TODO`s in the generated project directory -- they're accompanied by lots of comments explaining what you'll need to do in order to implement your connector. Upon completing all TODOs properly, you should have a functioning connector.

Additionally, you can follow [this tutorial](https://docs.airbyte.io/connector-development/tutorials/cdk-tutorial-python-http) for a complete walkthrough of creating an HTTP connector using the Airbyte CDK.

### Concepts & Documentation

See the [concepts docs](docs/concepts/) for a tour through what the API offers.

### Example Connectors

**HTTP Connectors**:

* [Exchangerates API](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-exchange-rates/source_exchange_rates/source.py)
* [Stripe](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-stripe/source_stripe/source.py)
* [Slack](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-slack/source_slack/source.py)

**Singer connectors**:

* [Salesforce](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-salesforce-singer/source_salesforce_singer/source.py)
* [Github](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-github-singer/source_github_singer/source.py)

**Simple Python connectors using the barebones `Source` abstraction**:

* [Google Sheets](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-google-sheets/google_sheets_source/google_sheets_source.py)
* [Mailchimp](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-mailchimp/source_mailchimp/source.py)

### First time setup

We assume `python` points to python &gt;=3.9.

Setup a virtual env:

```text
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]" # [dev] installs development-only dependencies
```

#### Iteration

* Iterate on the code locally
* Run tests via `python -m pytest -s unit_tests`
* Perform static type checks using `mypy airbyte_cdk`. `MyPy` configuration is in `.mypy.ini`.
* The `type_check_and_test.sh` script bundles both type checking and testing in one convenient command. Feel free to use it!

##### Autogenerated files
If the iteration you are working on includes changes to the models, you might want to regenerate them. In order to do that, you can run:
```commandline
SUB_BUILD=CONNECTORS_BASE ./gradlew format --scan --info --stacktrace
```
This will generate the files based on the schemas, add the license information and format the code. If you want to only do the former and rely on pre-commit to the others, you can run the appropriate generation command i.e. `./gradlew generateProtocolClassFiles` or `./gradlew generateComponentManifestClassFiles`.

#### Testing

All tests are located in the `unit_tests` directory. Run `python -m pytest --cov=airbyte_cdk unit_tests/` to run them. This also presents a test coverage report.

#### Building a connector with your local CDK

When developing a new feature in the CDK, you may find it helpful to run a connector that uses that new feature. You can test this in one of two ways:
* Running a connector locally
* Building and running a source via Docker

##### Installing your local CDK into a local Python connector

In order to get a local Python connector running your local CDK, do the following.

First, make sure you have your connector's virtual environment active:
```bash
# from the `airbyte/airbyte-integrations/connectors/<connector-directory>` directory
source .venv/bin/activate

# if you haven't installed dependencies for your connector already
pip install -e .
```

Then, navigate to the CDK and install it in editable mode:
```bash
cd ../../../airbyte-cdk/python
pip install -e .
```

You should see that `pip` has uninstalled the version of `airbyte-cdk` defined by your connector's `setup.py` and installed your local CDK. Any changes you make will be immediately reflected in your editor, so long as your editor's interpreter is set to your connector's virtual environment.

##### Building a Python connector in Docker with your local CDK installed

Create a symlink that connects `<connector-directory>/airbyte-cdk` to your local CDK installation:
```bash
# from the `airbyte/airbyte-integrations/connectors/<connector-directory>` directory
ln -s ../../../airbyte-cdk/python airbyte-cdk
```

Now that you have a symbolic link in your source, you will nedd to install it in the docker image. Depending on how the docker image is build you will have two possibilities:
1. If image building process uses a temporary image called `builder`, add the following just after the copy of the installed packages to the folder `/usr/local`: 
```Dockerfile
COPY airbyte-cdk airbyte-cdk
RUN PYTHONUSERBASE=/usr/local pip install -e ./airbyte-cdk
```
2. Add the following lines to your connector's `Dockerfile`, before the line that installs dependencies via `pip install -e .`:
```Dockerfile
COPY airbyte-cdk airbyte-cdk
RUN pip install -e ./airbyte-cdk
```

Add the following to your connectors `build.gradle` file:
```java
airbyteDocker {
    followSymlinks = true
}
```

You should be able to build your connector with
```bash
# from the airbytehq/airbyte base directory
./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:connectors:<connector-directory>:airbyteDocker
```
and the installation should use your local CDK. Note that the local CDK is injected at build time, so if you make changes, you will have to run the build command again to see them reflected.
**Note:** if your connector uses a `.dockerignore` file, it cannot have `exclude-all` or `exclude-except` patterns, i.e. the `.dockerignore` must specifically say which files to ignore without using any regex. 
#### Publishing a new version to PyPi

1. Open a PR
2. Once it is approved and merge, an Airbyte member must run the `Publish CDK Manually` workflow using `release-type=major|manor|patch` and setting the changelog message.
