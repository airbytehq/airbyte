/**
 * This enum describes the standard auth levels for a given resource. It currently is only used for
 * 2 resources Workspace and Instance (i.e. the entire instance or deployment of Airbyte).
 *
 * In the context of a workspace, there is a 1:1 mapping.
 * <ul>
 * <li>OWNER => WORKSPACE OWNER. Superadmin of the instance (typically the person that created it),
 * has all the rights on the instance including deleting it.</li>
 * <li>ADMIN => WORKSPACE ADMIN. Admin of the instance, can invite other users, update their
 * permission and change settings of the instance.</li>
 * <li>EDITOR => WORKSPACE EDITOR</li>
 * <li>READER => WORKSPACE READER</li>
 * <li>AUTHENTICATED_USER => INVALID</li>
 * <li>NONE => NONE (does not have access to this resource)</li>
 * </ul>
 * In the context of the instance, there are currently only 3 levels.
 * <ul>
 * <li>ADMIN => INSTANCE ADMIN</li>
 * <li>AUTHENTICATED_USER => Denotes that all that is required for access is an active Airbyte
 * account. This should only ever be used when the associated resource is an INSTANCE. All other
 * uses are invalid. It is a special value in the enum to handle a case that only applies to
 * instances and no other resources.</li>
 * <li>NONE => NONE (not applicable. anyone being checked in our auth stack already has an account
 * so by definition they have some access to the instance.)</li>
