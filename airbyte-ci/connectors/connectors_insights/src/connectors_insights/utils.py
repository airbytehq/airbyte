    Wrap a command execution with some bash sugar to always exit with a 0 exit code but write the actual exit code to a file.

    Underlying issue:
        When a classic dagger with_exec is returning a >0 exit code an ExecError is raised.
        It's OK for the majority of our container interaction.
        But some execution, like running CAT, are expected to often fail.
        In CAT we don't want ExecError to be raised on container interaction because CAT might write updated secrets that we need to pull from the container after the test run.
        The bash trick below is a hack to always return a 0 exit code but write the actual exit code to a file.
        The file is then read by the pipeline to determine the exit code of the container.

        command (List[str]): The command to run in the container.
