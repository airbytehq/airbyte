    """
    Construct a registry entry write path from its parts.

    Underlying issue:
        This is barely a hack.

        But it is related to a few imperfect design decisions that we have to work around.
        1. Metadata files and the registry entries are saved to the same top level folder.
        2. That save path is determined by the docker repository and version of the image
        3. A metadata file can include overrides for the docker repository and version of the image depending on the registry
        4. The platform looks up registry entries by docker repository and version of the image.
        5. The registry generation depends on what ever registry entry is written to a path ending in latest/{registry_name}.json

        This means that when a metadata file overrides the docker repository and version of the image,
        the registry entry needs to be written to a different path than the metadata file.

        *But only in the case that its a versioned path and NOT a latest path.*

        Example:
        If metadata file for source-posgres is at version 2.0.0 but there is a override for the cloud registry
        that changes the docker repository to source-postgres-strict-encrypt and the version to 1.0.0

        Then we will have a metadata file written to:
        gs://my-bucket/metadata/source-postgres/2.0.0/metadata.yaml

        and registry entries written to:
        gs://my-bucket/metadata/source-postgres/2.0.0/oss.json
        gs://my-bucket/metadata/source-postgres-strict-encrypt/1.0.0/cloud.json

        But if the metadata file is written to a latest path, then the registry entry will be written to the same path:
        gs://my-bucket/metadata/source-postgres/latest/oss.json
        gs://my-bucket/metadata/source-postgres/latest/cloud.json

        Future Solution:
        To resolve this properly we need to
        1. Separate the save paths for metadata files and registry entries
        2. Have the paths determined by definitionId and a metadata version
        3. Allow for references to other metadata files in the metadata file instead of overrides

        registry_entry (PolymorphicRegistryEntry): The registry entry to write
        registry_name (str): The name of the registry entry (oss or cloud)
