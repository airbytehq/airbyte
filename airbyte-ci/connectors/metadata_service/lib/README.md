# Connector Metadata Service Library

This submodule is responsible for managing all the logic related to validating, uploading, and managing connector metadata.

## Installation

To use this submodule, it is recommended that you use Poetry to manage dependencies.

```
poetry install
```


## Generating Models

This submodule includes a tool for generating Python models from JSON Schema specifications. To generate the models, we use the library [datamodel-code-generator](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator). The generated models are stored in `models/generated`.

To generate the models, run the following command:

```bash
poetry poe generate-models

```

This will read the JSON Schema specifications in `models/src` and generate Python models in `models/generated`.


## Running Tests
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

## Validating Metadata Files
```bash
poetry run metadata_service validate tests/fixtures/valid/metadata_registry_override.yaml
```
