# Connector Metadata Service Library

This submodule is responsible for managing all the logic related to validating, uploading, and managing connector metadata.

## Installation

To use this submodule, it is recommended that you use Poetry to manage dependencies.

```
poetry install
```


## Generating Models

This submodule includes a tool for generating Python models from JSON Schema specifications. To generate the models, we use the library [datamodel-code-generator](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator). The generated models are stored in `models/generated`.

To generate the models, run the following command:

```bash
poetry run poe generate-models

```

This will read the JSON Schema specifications in `models/src` and generate Python models in `models/generated`.


## Running Tests
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

## Validating Metadata Files
```bash
poetry run metadata_service validate tests/fixtures/valid/metadata_registry_override.yaml
```

## Useful Commands

### Replicate Production Data in your Development Bucket
This will replicate all the production data to your development bucket. This is useful for testing the metadata service with real up to date data.

_üí° Note: A prerequisite is you have [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) installed and have run `gsutil auth login`_

_‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Its important to know that this will remove ANY files you have in your destination buckets as it calls `gsutil rsync` with `-d` enabled._

```bash
TARGET_BUCKET=<YOUR-DEV_BUCKET> poetry poe replicate-prod
```

### Copy specific connector version to your Development Bucket
This will copy the specified connector version to your development bucket. This is useful for testing the metadata service with a specific version of a connector.

_üí° Note: A prerequisite is you have [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) installed and have run `gsutil auth login`_

```bash
TARGET_BUCKET=<YOUR-DEV_BUCKET> CONNECTOR="airbyte/source-stripe" VERSION="3.17.0-dev.ea013c8741" poetry poe copy-connector-from-prod
```

### Promote Connector Version to Latest
This will promote the specified connector version to the latest version in the registry. This is useful for creating a mocked registry in which a prerelease connector is treated as if it was already published.

_üí° Note: A prerequisite is you have [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) installed and have run `gsutil auth login`_

_‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Its important to know that this will remove ANY existing files in the latest folder that are not in the versioned folder as it calls `gsutil rsync` with `-d` enabled._

```bash
TARGET_BUCKET=<YOUR-DEV_BUCKET> CONNECTOR="airbyte/source-stripe" VERSION="3.17.0-dev.ea013c8741" poetry poe promote-connector-to-latest
```
