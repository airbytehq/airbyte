    Download the latest CDK version to update the pip cache.

    Underlying issue:
        Most Python connectors, or normalization, are not pinning the CDK version they use.
        It means that the will get whatever version is in the pip cache.
        But the original goal of not pinning the CDK version is to always get the latest version.

    Hack:
        Call this function before building connector test environment to update the cache with the latest CDK version.

    Github Issue:
        Revisiting and aligning how we build Python connectors and using the same container for test, build and publish will provide better control over the CDK version.

    Wrap a command execution with some bash sugar to always exit with a 0 exit code but write the actual exit code to a file.

    Underlying issue:
        When a classic dagger with_exec is returning a >0 exit code an ExecError is raised.
        It's OK for the majority of our container interaction.
        But some execution, like running CAT, are expected to often fail.
        In CAT we don't want ExecError to be raised on container interaction because CAT might write updated secrets that we need to pull from the container after the test run.
        The bash trick below is a hack to always return a 0 exit code but write the actual exit code to a file.
        The file is then read by the pipeline to determine the exit code of the container.

        command (List[str]): The command to run in the container.
