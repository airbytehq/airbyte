    Download the latest CDK version to update the pip cache.

    Underlying issue:
        Most Python connectors, or normalization, are not pinning the CDK version they use.
        It means that the will get whatever version is in the pip cache.
        But the original goal of not pinning the CDK version is to always get the latest version.

    Hack:
        Call this function before building connector test environment to update the cache with the latest CDK version.

    Github Issue:
        Revisiting and aligning how we build Python connectors and using the same container for test, build and publish will provide better control over the CDK version.
