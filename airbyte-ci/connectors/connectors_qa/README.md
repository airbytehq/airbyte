# Connectors QA

This package has two main purposes:

- Running assets and metadata verification checks on connectors.
- Generating the QA checks documentation that are run on connectors.

## Usage

### Install

Connectors QA is an internal Airbyte package that is not published to PyPI. To install it, run the
following command from this directory:

```bash
pipx install .
```

This will make `connectors-qa` available in your `PATH`.

Feel free to run `connectors-qa --help` to see the available commands and options.

### Examples

#### Running QA checks on one or more connectors:

```bash
# This command must run from the root of the Airbyte repo
connectors-qa run --name=source-faker --name=source-google-sheets
```

#### Running QA checks on all connectors:

```bash
# This command must run from the root of the Airbyte repo
connectors-qa run --connector-directory=airbyte-integrations/connectors
```

#### Running QA checks on all connectors and generating a JSON report:

```bash
### Generating documentation for QA checks:
connectors-qa run --connector-directory=airbyte-integrations/connectors --report-path=qa_report.json
```

#### Running only specific QA checks on one or more connectors:

```bash
connectors-qa run --name=source-faker --name=source-google-sheets --check=CheckConnectorIconIsAvailable --check=CheckConnectorUsesPythonBaseImage
```

#### Running only specific QA checks on all connectors:

```bash
connectors-qa run --connector-directory=airbyte-integrations/connectors --check=CheckConnectorIconIsAvailable --check=CheckConnectorUsesPythonBaseImage
```

#### Generating documentation for QA checks:

```bash
connectors-qa generate-documentation qa_checks.md
```

## Development

```bash
poetry install --with dev
```

### Dependencies

This package uses two local dependencies:

- [`connector_ops`](../connector_ops): To interact with the `Connector` object.
- [`metadata_service/lib`](../metadata_service/lib): To validate the metadata of the connectors.

### Adding a new QA check

To add a new QA check, you have to create add new class in one of the `checks` module. This class
must inherit from `models.Check` and implement the `_run` method. Then, you need to add an instance
of this class to the `ENABLED_CHECKS` list of the module.

**Please run the `generate-documentation` command to update the documentation with the new check and
commit it in your PR.**:

```bash
# From airbyte repo root
connectors-qa generate-documentation docs/contributing-to-airbyte/resources/qa-checks.md
```

### Running tests

```bash
poe test
```

### Running type checks

```bash
poe type_check
```

### Running the linter

```bash
poe lint
```
