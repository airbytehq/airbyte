    Dataline API
    [https://dataline.io](https://dataline.io).

    This API is a collection HTTP RPC-style methods. While it is not a REST API, those familiar with REST should find the conventions of this API recognizable.

    Here are some conventions that this API follows:
    * All endpoints are http POST methods.
    * All endpoints accept data via `application/json` request bodies. The API does not accept any data via query params.
    *  The naming convention for endpoints is: localhost:8080/{VERSION}/{METHOD_FAMILY}/{METHOD_NAME} e.g. `localhost:8080/v1/connections/create` or `localhost:8080/v1/connections/create`.
    * For all `update` method, the whole object must be passed in, even the fields that did not change.

    Change Management:
    * The major version of the API endpoint can be determined / specified in the URL `localhost:8080/v1/connections/create`
    * Minor version bumps will be visible to the end user. The user cannot specify minor versions in requests.
    * All backwards incompatible changes will happen in major version bumps. We will not make backwards incompatible changes in minor version bumps. Examples of non-breaking changes (includes but not limited to...):
      * Adding fields to request or response bodies.
      * Adding new HTTP endpoints.
