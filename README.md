**Data integration made simple, secure and extensible.**  
The new open-source standard to sync data from applications, APIs & databases to warehouses.

Airbyte is on a mission to make data integration pipelines a commodity.

* **Maintenance-free connectors you can use in minutes**. Just authenticate your sources and warehouse, and get connectors that adapt to schema and API changes for you.
* **Building new connectors made trivial.** We make it very easy to add new connectors that you need, using the language of your choice, by offering scheduling and orchestration. 
* Designed to **cover the long tail of connectors and needs**. Benefit from the community's battle-tested connectors and adapt them to your specific needs.
* **Your data stays in your cloud**. Have full control over your data, and the costs of your data transfers. 
* **No more security compliance process** to go through as Airbyte is self-hosted. 
* **No more pricing indexed on volume**, as cloud-based solutions offer. 

Here's a list of our [connectors with their health status](docs/integrations/connector-health.md).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git
cd airbyte
docker-compose up
```

Now visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Here is a [step-by-step guide](docs/getting-started.md) showing you how to load data from an API into a file, all on your computer.

## Features

* **Built for extensibility**: Adapt an existing connector to your needs or build a new one with ease.
* **Optional normalized schemas**: Entirely customizable, start with raw data or from some suggestion of normalized data.
* **Full-grade scheduler**: Automate your replications with the frequency you need.
* **Real-time monitoring**: We log all errors in full detail to help you understand.
* **Incremental updates**: Automated replications are based on incremental updates to reduce your data transfer costs.
* **Manual full refresh**: Sometimes, you need to re-sync all your data to start again.
* **Debugging autonomy**: Modify and debug pipelines as you see fit, without waiting.

## Contributing

We love contributions to Airbyte, big or small.

See our [Contributing guide](docs/contributing-to-airbyte/) on how to get started. Not sure where to start? Weâ€™ve listed some [good first issues](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/labels/good%20first%20issue) to start with. You can also [book a free, no-pressure pairing session](https://drift.me/micheltricot/meeting) with one of our core contributors.

**Note that you are able to create connectors using the language you want, as Airbyte connections run as Docker containers.**

**Also, we will never ask you to maintain your connector. The goal is that the Airbyte team and the community helps maintain it, let's call it crowdsourced maintenance!**
