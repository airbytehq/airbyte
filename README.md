Dataline is on a mission to make data integration pipelines a commodity.

- **Maintenance-free connectors you can use in minutes**. Just authenticate your sources and warehouse, and get connectors that adapts to schema and API changes for you.
- On a mission to **cover the long tail of integrations**, as Dataline will be very active in maintaining the pipelines’ reliability. 
- **Building new integrations made trivial**. We make it very easy to add new integrations that you need, by offering scheduling and orchestration. 
- **Your data stays in your cloud**. Have full control over your data, and the costs of your data transfers. 
- **No more security compliance process** to go through as self-hosted. 
- **No more pricing indexed on volume**, as cloud-based solutions offer.
