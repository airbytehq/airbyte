We believe that only an **open-source** solution to data movement can cover the **long tail of data sources** while empowering data engineers to **customize existing connectors**. Our ultimate vision is to help you move data from any source to any destination. Airbyte already provides [300+ connectors](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/) for popular APIs, databases, data warehouses and data lakes.

Airbyte connectors can be implemented in any language and take the form of a Docker image that follows the [Airbyte specification](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol/). You can create new connectors very fast with:
 - The [low-code Connector Development Kit](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/low-code-cdk-overview) (CDK) for API connectors ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7VSL2bDvmw))
 - The [Python CDK](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/cdk-python/) ([tutorial](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/tutorials/cdk-speedrun))

Airbyte has a built-in scheduler and uses [Temporal](https://airbyte.com/blog/scale-workflow-orchestration-with-temporal) to orchestrate jobs and ensure reliability at scale. Airbyte leverages [dbt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saXwh6SpeHA) to normalize extracted data and can trigger custom transformations in SQL and dbt. You can also orchestrate Airbyte syncs with [Airflow](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/using-the-airflow-airbyte-operator), [Prefect](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/using-prefect-task) or [Dagster](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/using-dagster-integration).

![Airbyte OSS Connections UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2302748/205949986-5207ca24-f1f0-41b1-97e1-a0745a0de55a.png)

Explore our [demo app](https://demo.airbyte.io/).

## Quick start

### Run Airbyte locally

You can run Airbyte locally with Docker.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git
cd airbyte
docker compose up
```

Login to the web app at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) by entering the default credentials found in your .env file.

```
BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=airbyte
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=password
```

Follow web app UI instructions to set up a source, destination and connection to replicate data. Connections support the most popular sync modes: full refresh, incremental and change data capture for databases.

Read the [Airbyte docs](https://docs.airbyte.com).

### Manage Airbyte configurations with code

You can also programmatically manage sources, destinations, and connections with YAML files, [Octavia CLI](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/tree/master/octavia-cli), and API.

### Deploy Airbyte to production

Deployment options: [Docker](https://docs.airbyte.com/deploying-airbyte/local-deployment), [AWS EC2](https://docs.airbyte.com/deploying-airbyte/on-aws-ec2), [Azure](https://docs.airbyte.com/deploying-airbyte/on-azure-vm-cloud-shell), [GCP](https://docs.airbyte.com/deploying-airbyte/on-gcp-compute-engine), [Kubernetes](https://docs.airbyte.com/deploying-airbyte/on-kubernetes), [Restack](https://docs.airbyte.com/deploying-airbyte/on-restack), [Plural](https://docs.airbyte.com/deploying-airbyte/on-plural), [Oracle Cloud](https://docs.airbyte.com/deploying-airbyte/on-oci-vm), [Digital Ocean](https://docs.airbyte.com/deploying-airbyte/on-digitalocean-droplet)...

### Use Airbyte Cloud

Airbyte Cloud is the fastest and most reliable way to run Airbyte. You can get started with free credits in minutes.

Sign up for [Airbyte Cloud](https://cloud.airbyte.io/signup).

## Contributing

Get started by checking Github issues and creating a Pull Request. An easy way to start contributing is to update an existing connector or create a new connector using the low-code and Python CDKs. You can find the code for existing connectors in the [connectors](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/tree/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors) directory. The Airbyte platform is written in Java, and the frontend in React. You can also contribute to our docs and tutorials. Advanced Airbyte users can apply to the [Maintainer program](https://airbyte.com/maintainer-program) and [Writer Program](https://airbyte.com/write-for-the-community).

Read the [Contributing guide](https://docs.airbyte.com/contributing-to-airbyte/).
