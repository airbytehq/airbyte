We believe that only an **open-source solution to data movement** can cover the long tail of data sources while empowering data engineers to customize existing connectors. Our ultimate vision is to help you move data from any source to any destination. Airbyte already provides the largest [catalog](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/) of 300+ connectors for APIs, databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.

### Getting Started
* [Deploy Airbyte Open Source](https://docs.airbyte.com/quickstart/deploy-airbyte) or set up [Airbyte Cloud](https://docs.airbyte.com/cloud/getting-started-with-airbyte-cloud) to start centralizing your data.
* Create connectors in minutes with our [no-code Connector Builder](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/overview) or [low-code CDK](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/low-code-cdk-overview).
* Explore popular use cases in our [tutorials](https://airbyte.com/tutorials).
* Orchestrate Airbyte syncs with [Airflow](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/using-the-airflow-airbyte-operator), [Prefect](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/using-prefect-task), [Dagster](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/using-dagster-integration) or the [Airbyte API](https://reference.airbyte.com/reference/start).
* Easily transform loaded data with [SQL](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/transformation-and-normalization/transformations-with-sql) or [dbt](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/transformation-and-normalization/transformations-with-dbt).
