"""Helpers for retrying functions with exponential back-off.

The :class:`Retry` decorator can be used to retry functions that raise
exceptions using exponential backoff. Because a exponential sleep algorithm is
used, the retry is limited by a `deadline`. The deadline is the maximum amount
of time a method can block. This is used instead of total number of retries
because it is difficult to ascertain the amount of time a function can block
when using total number of retries and exponential backoff.

By default, this decorator will retry transient
API errors (see :func:`if_transient_error`). For example:

.. code-block:: python

    @retry.Retry()
    def call_flaky_rpc():
        return client.flaky_rpc()

    # Will retry flaky_rpc() if it raises transient API errors.
    result = call_flaky_rpc()

You can pass a custom predicate to retry on different exceptions, such as
waiting for an eventually consistent item to be available:

.. code-block:: python

    @retry.Retry(predicate=if_exception_type(exceptions.NotFound))
    def check_if_exists():
        return client.does_thing_exist()

    is_available = check_if_exists()

Some client library methods apply retry automatically. These methods can accept
a ``retry`` parameter that allows you to configure the behavior:

.. code-block:: python

    my_retry = retry.Retry(deadline=60)
    result = client.some_method(retry=my_retry)

class Retry(object):
    """Exponential retry decorator.

    This class is a decorator used to add retry or polling behavior to an RPC
    call.

    Although the default behavior is to retry transient API errors, a
    different predicate can be provided to retry other exceptions.

    There two important concepts that retry/polling behavior may operate on,
    Deadline and Timeout, which need to be properly defined for the correct
    usage of this class and the rest of the library.

    Deadline: a fixed point in time by which a certain operation must
    terminate. For example, if a certain operation has a deadline
    "2022-10-18T23:30:52.123Z" it must terminate (successfully or with an
    error) by that time, regardless of when it was started or whether it
    was started at all.

    Timeout: the maximum duration of time after which a certain operation
    must terminate (successfully or with an error). The countdown begins right
    after an operation was started. For example, if an operation was started at
    09:24:00 with timeout of 75 seconds, it must terminate no later than
    09:25:15.

    Unfortunately, in the past this class (and the api-core library as a whole) has not been
    properly distinguishing the concepts of "timeout" and "deadline", and the
    ``deadline`` parameter has meant ``timeout``. That is why
    ``deadline`` has been deprecated and ``timeout`` should be used instead. If the
    ``deadline`` parameter is set, it will override the ``timeout`` parameter. In other words,
    ``retry.deadline`` should be treated as just a deprecated alias for
    ``retry.timeout``.

    Said another way, it is safe to assume that this class and the rest of this
    library operate in terms of timeouts (not deadlines) unless explicitly
    noted the usage of deadline semantics.

    It is also important to
    understand the three most common applications of the Timeout concept in the
    context of this library.

    Usually the generic Timeout term may stand for one of the following actual
    timeouts: RPC Timeout, Retry Timeout, or Polling Timeout.

    RPC Timeout: a value supplied by the client to the server so
    that the server side knows the maximum amount of time it is expected to
    spend handling that specific RPC. For example, in the case of gRPC transport,
    RPC Timeout is represented by setting "grpc-timeout" header in the HTTP2
    request. The `timeout` property of this class normally never represents the
    RPC Timeout as it is handled separately by the ``google.api_core.timeout``
    module of this library.

    Retry Timeout: this is the most common meaning of the ``timeout`` property
    of this class, and defines how long a certain RPC may be retried in case
    the server returns an error.

    Polling Timeout: defines how long the
    client side is allowed to call the polling RPC repeatedly to check a status of a
    long-running operation. Each polling RPC is
    expected to succeed (its errors are supposed to be handled by the retry
    logic). The decision as to whether a new polling attempt needs to be made is based
    not on the RPC status code but  on the status of the returned
    status of an operation. In other words: we will poll a long-running operation until the operation is done or the polling timeout expires. Each poll will inform us of the status of the operation. The poll consists of an RPC to the server that may itself be retried as per the poll-specific retry settings in case of errors. The operation-level retry settings do NOT apply to polling-RPC retries.

    With the actual timeout types being defined above, the client libraries
    often refer to just Timeout without clarifying which type specifically
    that is. In that case the actual timeout type (sometimes also referred to as
    Logical Timeout) can be determined from the context. If it is a unary rpc
    call (i.e. a regular one) Timeout usually stands for the RPC Timeout (if
    provided directly as a standalone value) or Retry Timeout (if provided as
    ``retry.timeout`` property of the unary RPC's retry config). For
    ``Operation`` or ``PollingFuture`` in general Timeout stands for
    Polling Timeout.
