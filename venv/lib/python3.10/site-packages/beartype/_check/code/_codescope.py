# ....................{ TODO                               }....................
#FIXME: Hah-hah! Finally figured out how to do recursive type hints... mostly.
#It's a two-parter consisting of:
#* *PART I.* In the first part:
#  * Refactor our code generation algorithm to additionally maintain a stack of
#    all parent type hints of the currently visited type hint. Note that we need
#    to do this anyway to support the __beartype_hint__() protocol. See "FIXME:"
#    comments in the "beartype.plug._plughintable" submodule pertaining to that
#    protocol for further details on properly building out this stack.
#  * When that algorithm visits a forward reference:
#    * That algorithm calls the express_func_scope_type_forwardref() function
#      generating type-checking code for that reference. Refactor that call to
#      additionally pass that stack of parent hints to that function.
#    * Refactor the express_func_scope_type_forwardref() function to:
#      * If the passed forward reference is relative, additionally return that
#        stack in the returned 3-tuple
#        "(forwardref_expr, forwardrefs_class_basename, forwardref_parent_hints)",
#        where "forwardref_parent_hints" is that stack.
#* *PART II.* In the second part:
#  * Refactor the beartype._decor.wrap.wrapmain._unmemoize_func_wrapper_code()
#    function to additionally:
#    * If the passed forward reference is relative *AND* the unqualified
#      basename of an existing attribute in a local or global scope of the
#      currently decorated callable *AND* the value of that attribute is a
#      parent type hint on the stack of parent type hints returned by the
#      previously called express_func_scope_type_forwardref() function, then
#      *THIS REFERENCE INDICATES A RECURSIVE TYPE HINT.* In this case:
#      * Replace this forward reference with a new recursive type-checking
#        "beartype._check.forward._fwdref.BeartypeForwardRef_{forwardref}"
#        subclass whose is_instance() tester method recursively calls itself
#        indefinitely. If doing so generates a "RecursionError", @beartype
#        considers that the user's problem. *wink*
#
#Done and done. Phew!

    Add a new **scoped tuple of classes** (i.e., new key-value pair of the
    passed dictionary mapping from the name to value of each globally or
    locally scoped attribute externally accessed elsewhere, whose key is a
    machine-readable name internally generated by this function to uniquely
    refer to the passed set or tuple of classes and whose value is that tuple)
    to the passed scope *and* return that machine-readable name.

    This function additionally caches this tuple with the beartypistry
    singleton to reduce space consumption for tuples duplicated across the
    active Python interpreter.

    Design
    ----------
    Unlike types, tuples are commonly dynamically constructed on-the-fly by
    various tuple factories (e.g., :attr:`beartype.cave.NoneTypeOr`,
    :attr:`typing.Optional`) and hence have no reliable fully-qualified names.
    Instead, this function caches this tuple into the beartypistry under a
    string synthesized as the unique concatenation of:

    * The magic substring :data:`TYPISTRY_HINT_NAME_TUPLE_PREFIX`. Since
      fully-qualified classnames uniquely identifying types as beartypistry
      keys are guaranteed to *never* contain this substring, this substring
      prevents collisions between tuple and type names.
    * This tuple's hash. Note that this tuple's object ID is intentionally
      *not* embedded in this string. Two tuples with the same items are
      typically different objects and thus have different object IDs, despite
      producing identical hashes: e.g.,

      >>> ('Das', 'Kapitel',) is ('Das', 'Kapitel',)
      False
      >>> id(('Das', 'Kapitel',)) == id(('Das', 'Kapitel',))
      False
      >>> hash(('Das', 'Kapitel',)) == hash(('Das', 'Kapitel',))
      True

    The exception is the empty tuple, which is a singleton and thus *always*
    has the same object ID and hash: e.g.,

        >>> () is ()
        True
        >>> id(()) == id(())
        True
        >>> hash(()) == hash(())
        True

    Identifying tuples by their hashes enables the beartypistry singleton to
    transparently cache duplicate class tuples with distinct object IDs as the
    same underlying object, reducing space consumption. While hashing tuples
    does impact time performance, the gain in space is worth the cost.

    Parameters
    ----------
    types : _SetOrTupleOfTypes
        Set or tuple of arbitrary types to be added to this scope.
    func_scope : LexicalScope
        Local or global scope to add this object to.
    is_unique : bool, optional
        ``True`` only if the caller guarantees this tuple to contain *no*
        duplicate types. This boolean is ignored if ``types`` is a set rather
        than tuple. Defaults to ``False``. If ``False``, this function assumes
        this tuple to contain duplicate types by internally:

        #. Coercing this tuple into a set, thus implicitly ignoring both
           duplicates and ordering of types in this tuple.
        #. Coercing that set back into another tuple.
        #. If these two tuples differ, the passed tuple contains one or more
           duplicates; in this case, the duplicate-free tuple is cached and
           passed.
        #. Else, the passed tuple contains no duplicates; in this case, the
           passed tuple is cached and passed.

        This boolean does *not* simply enable an edge-case optimization, though
        it certainly does that; this boolean enables callers to guarantee that
        this function caches and passes the passed tuple rather than a new
        tuple internally created by this function.
    exception_prefix : str, optional
        Human-readable label prefixing the representation of this object in the
        exception message. Defaults to the empty string.

    Returns
    ----------
    str
        Name of this tuple in this scope generated by this function.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeDecorHintNonpepException
