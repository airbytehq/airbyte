# bitsandbytes contains several extensions for CPU and different CUDA versions: libbitsandbytes_cpu.so,
# libbitsandbytes_cuda110_nocublaslt.so, libbitsandbytes_cuda110.so, etc. At build-time, we could query the
# `bitsandbytes.cextension.setup` and its `binary_nameË™ attribute for the extension that is in use. However, if the
# build system does not have CUDA available, this would automatically mean that we will not collect any of the CUDA
# libs. So for now, we collect them all.

# bitsandbytes uses triton's JIT module, which requires access to source .py files.
