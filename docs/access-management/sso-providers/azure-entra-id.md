:::info

From the overview page of Entra ID, press **Add** > **App registration** on the top of the screen.

```
https://cloud.airbyte.com/auth/realms/<your-company-identifier>/broker/default/endpoint
```

Hit **Register** to create the application.

### Create Client credentials

We recommend to chose an expiry date of at least 12 months. You'll need to pass in the new client secret every time the old one expires to continue being able to log in via Entra ID.
:::

Copy the **Value** (the Client Secret itself) immediately after creation. You won't be able to view this later on.

### Setup information needed

You'll need to pass your Airbyte contact the following information of the created application.

* **Client Secret**: as copied above
* **Application (client) ID**: You'll find this in the **Essentials** section on the **Overview** page of the application you created
* **OpenID Connect metadata document**: You'll find this in the **Endpoints** panel, that you can open from the top bar on the **Overview** page

Once we've received this information from you, We'll setup SSO for you and let you know once it's ready to be used.

    * Client ID: You'll find this in the **Essentials** section on the **Overview** page of the application you created.
    * Client Secret: The client secret you copied in the previous step.

Use this information to configure the auth details of your `airbyte.yml` for your Self-Managed Enterprise deployment. To learn more on deploying Self-Managed Enterprise, see our [implementation guide](/enterprise-setup/implementation-guide).
