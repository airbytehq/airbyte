# Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role Based Access Control allows a user with Administrative access to apply roles to users, granting different levels of permission within an organization or workspace. 

RBAC roles donâ€™t require a customer to use SSO and can be enabled on any organization.

## Workspace Resource Roles
A user can have at most one role of this kind per workspace. Permissions are scoped to the specific workspace in which the user has this role.
