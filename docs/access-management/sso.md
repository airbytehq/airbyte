# Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows you to enable logging into Airbyte using your existing Identity Provider (IdP) like Okta or Active Directory.

SSO is available in Airbyte Enterprise and on Cloud with Teams. [Talk to us](https://airbyte.com/company/talk-to-sales) to get started setting up SSO for your organization.

You can find setup explanations for all our supported Identity Providers on the following subpages:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
