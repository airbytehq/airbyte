# Existing Instance Upgrades

This page supplements the [Self-Managed Enterprise implementation guide](./implementation-guide.md). It highlights the steps to take if you are currently using Airbyte Self-Managed Community, our free open source offering, and are ready to upgrade to [Airbyte Self-Managed Enterprise](./README.md). 

A valid license key is required to get started with Airbyte Enterprise. [Talk to sales](https://airbyte.com/company/talk-to-sales) to receive your license key. 

These instructions are for you if:
* You want your Self-Managed Enterprise instance to inherit state from your existing deployment.
* You are currently deploying Airbyte on Kubernetes.
* You are comfortable with an in-place upgrade. This guide does not dual-write to a new Airbyte deployment.

### Step 1: Update Airbyte Open Source

You must first update to the latest Open Source community release. We assume you are running the following steps from the root of the `airbytehq/airbyte-platform` cloned repo.

1. Determine your current helm release name by running `helm list`. This will now be referred to as `[RELEASE_NAME]` for the rest of this guide.
2. Upgrade to the latest Open Source community release. The output will now be refered to as `[RELEASE_VERSION]` for the rest of this guide:

```sh
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] airbyte/airbyte
```

### Step 2: Configure Self-Managed Enterprise

At this step, please create and fill out the `airbyte.yml` as explained in the [Self-Managed Enterprise implementation guide](./implementation-guide.md#clone--configure-airbyte) in the `configs` directory. You should avoid making any changes to your Airbyte database or log storage at this time. When complete, you should have a completed file matching the following skeleton:

<details>
<summary>Configuring your airbyte.yml file</summary>

```yml
webapp-url: # example: localhost:8080

initial-user:
  email: 
  first-name: 
  last-name: 
  username: # your existing Airbyte instance username
  password: # your existing Airbyte instance password

license-key: 

auth:
  identity-providers:
    - type: okta
      domain: 
      app-name: 
      client-id: 
      client-secret: 
```

</details>

### Step 3: Deploy Self-Managed Enterprise

1. You can now run the following command to upgrade your instance to Self-Managed Enterprise. If you previously included additional `values` files on your existing deployment, be sure to add these here as well:

```sh
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] airbyte/airbyte \
--version [RELEASE_VERSION] \
--set-file airbyteYml=./configs/airbyte.yml \
--values ./charts/airbyte/airbyte-pro-values.yaml [... additional --values] 	
```

2. Once this is complete, you will need to upgrade your ingress to include the new `/auth` path. The following is a skimmed down definition of an ingress resource you could use for Self-Managed Enterprise:

<details>
<summary>Configuring your Airbyte ingress</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: # ingress name, example: enterprise-demo
  annotations:
    ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: # host, example: enterprise-demo.airbyte.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            # format is ${RELEASE_NAME}-airbyte-webapp-svc
            name: airbyte-pro-airbyte-webapp-svc 
            port:
              number: # service port, example: 8080
        path: /
        pathType: Prefix
      - backend:
          service:
            # format is ${RELEASE_NAME}-airbyte-keycloak-svc
            name: airbyte-pro-airbyte-keycloak-svc
            port:
              number: # service port, example: 8180
        path: /auth
        pathType: Prefix
```

</details>

All set! When you log in, you should expect all connections, sources and destinations to be present, and configured as prior.
