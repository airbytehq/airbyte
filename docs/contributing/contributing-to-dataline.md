# Contributing to Dataline

## Reporting Bugs or Issues

Bug reports help us make Dataline better for everyone. We provide a preconfigured template for bugs to make it very clear what information we need.

Please search within our issues before raising a new one to make sure you're not raising a duplicate.

**Important:** If you've found a security issue, please email us directly at [hey@dataline.io](mailto:hey@dataline.io) instead of raising an issue.

## Review Process

As soon as you are done with your development, just put up a PR.

When we review we look at:

* Does the PR solve the issue?
* Is the proposed solution reasonable?
* Is it tested? \(unit tests or integration tests\)
* Is it introducing security risks?
* Does it pass QA?

Once your PR passes, we will merge it.
