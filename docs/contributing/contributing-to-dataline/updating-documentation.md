# Updating Documentation

Our documentation uses [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) and all the [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files are stored in our Github repository.

There are 3 different ways you can update the documentation.

## `Edit on GitHub` button

On the page you want to update, just click the `Edit on GitHub` link in the right column. That will get you directly to the file on GitHub that you need to modify. You can use their editor to update the file. Once you're satisfied with your change you can submit a PR.

We recommend that method for changes limited to one file \(typo, updates\).

## Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:datalineio/dataline.git
```

All our docs are stored in the `docs` directory. You can use other files as example.

If you're adding new files, don't forget to update `docs/SUMMARY.md`.

Once you're satisfied with your changes just follow the regular PR process.

## Edit on GitBook

To update with GitBook, follow these instructions:

1. Create a [new variant](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/variants#create-a-variant). This will create a branch on [GitHub](https://github.com/datalineio/dataline) with the name of the variant
2. Modify the documentation in that new variant
3. Save & merge regularly
4. Once you're satisfied go on [GitHub](https://github.com/datalineio/dataline) and create a PR for your variant branch
5. Once reviewed it will be merge to our master documentation

Just [contact us](mailto:hey@dataline.io) and we will invite you to our space.
