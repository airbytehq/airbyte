# Developing Locally

## Build with `gradle`

Dataline uses `java 14` , `node 14` and `Docker`

To compile the code and run unit tests:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:datalineio/dataline.git
cd dataline
./gradlew clean build
```

This will build all the code and run all the unit tests.

`./gradle build` creates all the necessary artifacts \(Webapp, Jars and Docker images\) so that you can run dataline locally.

## Run with `docker-compose`

```bash
./gradlew build
VERSION=dev docker-compose up
```

The build will take a few minutes. Once it completes, Dataline compiled at current git revision will be running in your environment.

## Run Acceptance Tests

To run acceptance \(end-to-end\) tests you must have the Dataline running locally. 

```bash
./gradlew build
VERSION=dev docker-compose up
./gradlew :dataline-tests:acceptanceTests
```

## Develop on individual applications

### Develop on `dataline-webapp`

* Spin up Dataline locally so the UI can make requests against the local API.

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.dev -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

* Stop the `webapp`.

```bash
docker-compose stop webapp
```

* Start up the react app.

```bash
cd dataline-webapp
npm install
npm start
```

* Happy Hacking!

### Develop on `dataline-server` \(APIs\)

* Spin up Dataline locally.

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.dev -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

* Stop the `server`.

```bash
docker-compose stop server
```

* Run the `server` with the command line. It will build and start a `server` with the current state of the code. You can also start the `server` from your IDE if you need to use a debugger.

```bash
./gradlew :dataline-server:run
```

* Make sure everything is working by testing out a call to the API.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json"\
 -X POST localhost:8001/api/v1/workspaces/get\
 -d '{ "workspaceId": "5ae6b09b-fdec-41af-aaf7-7d94cfc33ef6" }'
```

* Happy Hacking!

_Note: We namespace most API calls with a workspace id. For now there is only ever one workspace that is hardcoded to the id used in this example. If you ever need a workspace id, just use this one._

### Develop on `dataline-scheduler`

* Spin up Dataline locally.

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.dev -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

* Stop the `scheduler`.

```bash
docker-compose stop scheduler
```

* Run the `scheduler` with the command line. It will build and start a `scheduler` with the current state of the code. You can also start the `scheduler`from your IDE if you need to use a debugger.

```bash
./gradlew :dataline-scheduler:run
```

* Happy Hacking!
