# Updating Documentation

Our documentation uses [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) and all the [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files are stored in our Github repository.

There are 3 different ways you can update the documentation.

## `Edit on GitHub`

On the page you want to update, just click the `Edit on GitHub` link in the right column. That will get you directly to the file on GitHub that you need to modify. You can use their editor to update the file. Once you're satisfied with your change you can submit a PR. 

We recommend that method for changes limited to one file \(typo, updates\).

## Clone repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:datalineio/dataline.git
```

All our docs are stored in the `docs` directory. You can use other files as example.

If you're adding new files, don't forget to update `docs/SUMMARY.md`.

Once you're satisfied with your changes just follow the regular PR process.

## GitBook

You can edit the documentation on GitBook. You will able to use their convenient WYSIWYG editor.

All the changes you make on GitBook will be automatically synced with GitHub once they get reviewed.

Just [contact us](mailto:hey@dataline.io) and we will invite you to our space.
