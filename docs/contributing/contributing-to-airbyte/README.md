# Contributing to Airbyte

We hope you are enjoying Airbyte and we look forward to hearing your feedback. Whether you want to raise a bug report, a feature/integration request or just request a correction to something, we are eager to get input from our community.

We do ask that you read this document and send us any issues or raise pull requests to make sure we understand clearly what you are asking for. This will help ensure we are making the right decisions and taking the right actions.

**Note that you are able to create integrations using the language you want, as Airbyte connections run as Docker containers.**

## **Review process**

**‌‌**If you are considering adding to the codebase or contributing a new integration, first a big thank you. We sincerely appreciate your help in our mission to solve the data integration problem!

Here is a list of easy [good first issues](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/labels/good%20first%20issue) to do.

As soon as you are done with your development, just put up a PR.  
When we review we look at:

* ‌Does the PR solve the issue?
* Is the proposed solution reasonable?
* Is it tested? \(unit tests or integration tests\)
* Is it introducing security risks?
* Does it pass QA?

‌Once your PR passes, we will merge it.

## **Upvoting issues, feature and integration requests**

You are welcome to add your own reactions to the existing issues. We will take them in consideration in our prioritization efforts, especially for integrations.

❤️ means that this task is CRITICAL to you.  
👍 means it is important to you.

## **Contributing new integrations**

It's easy to add your own integrations to Airbyte! Here are some links to instructions on how to add sources and destinations. Please reach out to us if you'd like help developing integrations in other languages.

* [Contributing Sources \(Python\)](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/template/python-source/README.md)
* [Contributing Sources Based on Singer Taps \(Python\)](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/template/singer-source/README.md)
* [Contributing Destinations \(Java\)](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/template/java-destination/README.md)

## **Requesting new features**

To request new features, please create an issue on this project.

If you would like to suggest a new feature, we ask that you please use our issue template. It contains a few essential questions that help us understand the problem you are looking to solve and how you think your recommendation will address it. We also tag incoming issues from this template with the "**community\_new**" label. This lets our teams quickly see what has been raised and better address the community recommendations.

To see what has already been proposed by the community, you can look [here](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/labels/community_new).

Watch out for duplicates! If you are creating a new issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/airbyte.io/airbyte/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20). Having a single voted for issue is far easier for us to prioritize

## **Requesting new integrations**

This is very similar to requesting new features. The template will change a bit and all integration requests will be tagged with the “**community\_new**” and “**area/integration**” labels.

To see what has already been proposed by the community, you can look [here](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/labels/area%2Fintegration). Again, watch out for duplicates!

## **Reporting bugs**

**‌**Bug reports help us make Airbyte better for everyone. We provide a preconfigured template for bugs to make it very clear what information we need.

‌Please search within our [already reported bugs](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atype%2Fbug) before raising a new one to make sure you're not raising a duplicate.

## **Reporting security issues**

Please do not create a public GitHub issue. If you've found a security issue, please email us directly at [security@airbyte.io](mailto:security@airbyte.io) instead of raising an issue.
