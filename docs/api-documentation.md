# API documentation

:::caution

For Airbyte Open-Source you don't need the API Token for Authentication!
All endpoints are possible to access using the API without it. **Note**: Airbyte Cloud does not currently support API access. 

:::

Our Configuration API is still in alpha and might change. You won’t lose any functionality, but you may need to update your code to catch up to any backwards incompatible changes in the API.

**Check it out** [**here**](https://airbyte-public-api-docs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rapidoc-api-docs.html)**.** It is still rudimentary, and we will improve in the next couple of weeks.

Don't hesitate to ask us on [Slack](https://slack.airbyte.io), if you have any questions about it.
