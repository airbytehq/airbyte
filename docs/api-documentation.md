# API documentation

## Open-Source API

Airbyte Open Source doesn't require an API Token for Authentication.
All endpoints are acccessible without the token.

:::caution

Our Open-Source API (configuration API) is still in an alpha state and might change. You wonâ€™t lose any functionality, but you may need to update your code to catch up to any backwards incompatible changes in the API.
