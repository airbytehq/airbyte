# API documentation

:::caution

For Airbyte Open-Source you don't need the API Token for Authentication!
All endpoints are possible to access using the API without it.

:::

Our Configuration API is still in alpha and might change. You won’t lose any functionality, but you may need to update your code to catch up to any backwards incompatible changes in the API.

**Check it out** [**here**](https://airbyte-public-api-docs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rapidoc-api-docs.html)**.**

Don't hesitate to ask us on [Slack](https://slack.airbyte.io), if you have any questions about it.

:::info

Airbyte Cloud will also support API access in 2023. See [Airbyte roadmap](https://app.harvestr.io/roadmap/view/pQU6gdCyc/airbyte-roadmap) for more details.
