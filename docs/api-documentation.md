# API documentation

The Airbyte API provides a way for developers to programmatically interact with Airbyte. It is available for all Airbyte products: Airbyte OSS, Cloud & Self-Hosted Enterprise.

Our API is a reliable, easy-to-use interface for programmatically controlling the Airbyte platform. It can be extended to:

- Enable users to control Airbyte programmatically and use with Orchestration tools (ex: Airflow)
- Enable [Powered by Airbyte](https://reference.airbyte.com/reference/powered-by-airbyte)

## Configuration API (Deprecated)

The configuration API is now deprecated and no longer supported. It is an internal API that is designed for communications between different Airbyte components ratther than managing your Airbyte workspace.

Users utilize the Config API at their own risk. This API is utilized internally by the Airbyte Engineering team and may be modified in the future if the need arises.
