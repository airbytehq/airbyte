## Open-Source API

:::caution

For Airbyte Open-Source you don't need the API Token for Authentication!
All endpoints are possible to access using the API without it.

:::

Our Open-Source API (configuration API) is still in an alpha state and might change. You wonâ€™t lose any functionality, but you may need to update your code to catch up to any backwards incompatible changes in the API.

**Check out the** [**Open-Source API documentation**](https://airbyte-public-api-docs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rapidoc-api-docs.html)**.**

Don't hesitate to ask us on [Slack](https://slack.airbyte.io), if you have any questions about it.
