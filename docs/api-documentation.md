# API documentation

Our Configuration API is still in alpha and might change. You wonâ€™t lose any functionality, but you may need to update your code to catch up to any backwards incompatible changes in the API.

**Here's its** [**documentation**](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airbytehq/airbyte/master/airbyte-api/src/main/openapi/config.yaml#/)**.** It is still rudimentary, and we will improve in the next couple of weeks.

Don't hesitate to ask us on [Slack](https://slack.airbyte.io), if you have any questions about it.
