| **Description**        | The Config API is an internal Airbyte API that is designed for communications between different Airbyte components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Airbyte API is designed for ease-of-use, reliability and full support by Airbyte team.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Status**            | ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨ API is in Alpha state. Airbyte does NOT have active commitments to support it. OSS users can interact with the Config API, but at their own risk of future breaking changes. <br /><br />  This API is utilized internally by the Airbyte Engineering team and can be changed by Airbyte Engineering if their needs require it, which could potentially break any external applications that are using it. If breaking changes did occur, OSS users would need to update their code to catch up to any backwards incompatible changes in the API. | Closed Beta.
