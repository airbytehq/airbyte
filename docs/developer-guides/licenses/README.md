# Licenses

Airbyte monorepo uses multiple licenses.

The license for a particular work is defined with following prioritized rules:

1. License directly present in the file
2. LICENSE file in the same directory as the work
3. First LICENSE found when exploring parent directories up to the project top level directory
4. Defaults to Elastic License 2.0

If you have any question regarding licenses, just visit our [FAQ](license-faq.md) or [contact us](mailto:license@airbyte.io).

If you want to see a list of examples supported by ELv2, and not, to have a better understanding whether you should be concerned or not, check the [examples](examples.md). 

**TL;DR:** Unless you want to host Airbyte yourself and sell it as an ELT/ETL tool, or to sell a product that directly exposes Airbyteâ€™s UI or API, you should be good to go!
