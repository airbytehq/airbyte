# Connecting EL with T using DBT \(part 2/2\)

## Overview

This tutorial will describe how to integrate SQL based transformations with Airbyte syncs using specialized transformation tool: DBT.

This tutorial is the second part of the previous tutorial [Connecting EL with T using SQL](connecting-el-with-t-using-sql.md).

## Run Transformations with DBT

The tool in charge of transformation behind the scenes is actually called [DBT](https://blog.getdbt.com/what--exactly--is-dbt-/) \(Data Build Tool\).

Before generating the SQL files as we've seen previously, Airbyte is setting up internally a Docker image where DBT is installed, and a DBT project is created as described in their [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/projects). It is run afterward, thanks to [DBT CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/cli-overview).

In the future, we will work on improving this DBT integration further... For example, it would probably be easier to customize and import your own DBT project within the Airbyte pipeline or connect with the [DBT Cloud](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-overview).

However, for now, let's see how to interact with the DBT tool.

Since the whole DBT project is properly configured, it is possible to invoke the CLI from within the docker image to trigger transformation processing:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
docker run --rm -i -v airbyte_workspace:/data -w /data/$NORMALIZE_WORKSPACE/normalize --network host --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/dbt airbyte/normalization debug --profiles-dir=. --project-dir=.
docker run --rm -i -v airbyte_workspace:/data -w /data/$NORMALIZE_WORKSPACE/normalize --network host --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/dbt airbyte/normalization run --profiles-dir=. --project-dir=.
```

Example Output:

As seen in the tutorial on [exploring workspace folder](exploring-workspace-folder.md), it is possible to browse the `normalize` folder and examine further logs if an error occurs.

In particular, we can also take a look at the DBT models generated by Airbyte and export them to the local host filesystem:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

TUTORIAL_DIR="$(pwd)/tutorial/"
rm -rf $TUTORIAL_DIR/normalization-files
mkdir -p $TUTORIAL_DIR/normalization-files

docker cp airbyte-server:/tmp/workspace/$NORMALIZE_WORKSPACE/normalize/ $TUTORIAL_DIR/normalization-files

NORMALIZE_DIR=$TUTORIAL_DIR/normalization-files/normalize
cd $NORMALIZE_DIR
cat $NORMALIZE_DIR/models/generated/*.sql
```

Example Output:

```text
with 
covid_epidemiology_node as (
  select 
    _airbyte_emitted_at,
    {{ dbt_utils.current_timestamp_in_utc()  }} as _airbyte_normalized_at,
    cast({{ json_extract_scalar('_airbyte_data', ['date'])  }} as {{ dbt_utils.type_string()  }}) as date,
    cast({{ json_extract_scalar('_airbyte_data', ['new_recovered'])  }} as {{ dbt_utils.type_float()  }}) as new_recovered,
    cast({{ json_extract_scalar('_airbyte_data', ['new_tested'])  }} as {{ dbt_utils.type_float()  }}) as new_tested,
    cast({{ json_extract_scalar('_airbyte_data', ['total_deceased'])  }} as {{ dbt_utils.type_float()  }}) as total_deceased,
    cast({{ json_extract_scalar('_airbyte_data', ['new_deceased'])  }} as {{ dbt_utils.type_float()  }}) as new_deceased,
    cast({{ json_extract_scalar('_airbyte_data', ['new_confirmed'])  }} as {{ dbt_utils.type_float()  }}) as new_confirmed,
    cast({{ json_extract_scalar('_airbyte_data', ['total_confirmed'])  }} as {{ dbt_utils.type_float()  }}) as total_confirmed,
    cast({{ json_extract_scalar('_airbyte_data', ['total_tested'])  }} as {{ dbt_utils.type_float()  }}) as total_tested,
    cast({{ json_extract_scalar('_airbyte_data', ['total_recovered'])  }} as {{ dbt_utils.type_float()  }}) as total_recovered,
    cast({{ json_extract_scalar('_airbyte_data', ['key'])  }} as {{ dbt_utils.type_string()  }}) as key
  from {{ source('quarantine', 'covid_epidemiology_raw')  }}
),
covid_epidemiology_with_id as (
  select
    *,
    {{ dbt_utils.surrogate_key([
        'date',
        'new_recovered',
        'new_tested',
        'total_deceased',
        'new_deceased',
        'new_confirmed',
        'total_confirmed',
        'total_tested',
        'total_recovered',
        'key'
    ])  }} as _airbyte_covid_epidemiology_hashid
    from covid_epidemiology_node
)
select * from covid_epidemiology_with_id
```

If you have [DBT installed](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation/) on your machine, you can then view, edit, customize and run the dbt models in your project if you want to bypass the normalization steps generated by Airbyte!

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash 

dbt deps --profiles-dir=$NORMALIZE_DIR --project-dir=$NORMALIZE_DIR
dbt run --profiles-dir=$NORMALIZE_DIR --project-dir=$NORMALIZE_DIR --full-refresh
```

Example Output:

```text

## Going further

For the moment, it is not possible to make changes to the generated DBT models and commit them back so Airbyte can use it in its next sync of a certain source/destination combination. But, we'll work on such integration in the near future!

Our DBT models are currently composed of only one model per final table to replicate, we would probably refine this and grow the transformation steps further, adding UI elements to configure what should be included or not in the normalization step.

However, if you have ideas on what to do with DBT from this point on, we would be glad to hear your feedbacks and ideas. Thank you!
