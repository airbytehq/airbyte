# Microsoft Dynamics AX

[MS Dynamics AX](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/ax) is a powerful enterprise resource planning \(ERP\) software package for finance and operations.

## Sync overview

MS Dynamics AX runs on the MSSQL database. You can use the [MSSQL connector](mssql.md) to sync your MS Dynamics AX instance by connecting to the underlying database.

### Output schema

To understand your MS Dynamics AX database schema, see the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamicsax-2012/developer/database-erds-on-the-axerd-website). Otherwise, the schema will be loaded according to the rules of MSSQL connector.
