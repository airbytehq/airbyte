# February 2023
## [airbyte v0.41.0](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/releases/tag/v0.41.0) and [airbyte-platform v0.41.0](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-platform/releases/tag/v0.41.0)

This page includes new features and improvements to the Airbyte Cloud and Airbyte Open Source platforms.

### Improvements
* Improved the Airbyte GitHub repository structure and processes by splitting the current repo into two repos, `airbytehq/airbyte` for connectors and `airbytehq/airbyte-platform` for platform code. 
    * Allows for isolated changes and improvements to the development workflow.
    * Simplifies the deployment process both internally and externally.

:::note

If you want to contribute to the Airbyte Open Source platform, you will need to switch to `airbytehq/airbyte-platform`. If you want to contribute to Airbyte connectors, continue using `airbytehq/airbyte`. 

:::

* Improved low-code CDK to meet the quality and functionality requirements to be promoted to beta. [#22853](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/22853)
* Improved the [Airbyte API](https://api.airbyte.com/) by adding new endpoints:
    * Create sources
    * Create connections
    * Create destinations
    * List jobs (+ job status)
    * Cancel jobs

:::note
