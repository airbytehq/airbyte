# Airbyte 1.4.0

Happy new year! Airbyte version 1.4.0 was released on January 17, 2025. We‚Äôre excited to share new improvements and changes to the Airbyte platform.

## üöÄ Platform Changes

Platform changes improve Airbyte for everyone with a self-managed instance.

### Configure the schema refresh rate

At the start of a sync, Airbyte occasionally re-runs schema discovery to detect changes in your source, such as new fields or a change in column type. But running schema discovery has a performance cost, and may not always be necessary before every sync. 

You may now use a new toggle, `DISCOVER_REFRESH_WINDOW_MINUTES`, to set the minimum number of minutes Airbyte will wait to refresh the schema for your sources. By setting a larger number, you run automatic schema detection less frequently, which can result in gains in sync performance. The default configuration in Airbyte Open Source is `1440`, which refreshes schemas every 24 hours. The lowest interval you can set is `1`, which refreshes schemas before every sync.

```yml title="values.yaml"
worker:
  env_vars:
    DISCOVER_REFRESH_WINDOW_MINUTES: 1440 # Airbyte automatically refreshes schemas no more than once per day (1440 minutes).
```

 Set this to 0 to disable automatic schema refreshes. All schema refreshes will need to be done manually via the Airbyte UI or API.

```yml title="values.yaml"
worker:
  env_vars:
    DISCOVER_REFRESH_WINDOW_MINUTES: 0 # Airbyte does not automatically detect schema changes.
```

### Connectors support custom image registries

Connectors can now use custom image registries rather than Airbyte‚Äôs public Docker registry. If you configure Airbyte to use a custom image registry, it now automatically uses that registry for connector images as well as platform images. Previously, only platform images supported this. In this example, we set Airbyte‚Äôs `values.yaml` file to pull all images from GitHub.

```yml title="values.yaml"
global:
  image:
    registry: ghcr.io/NAMESPACE
```

You must ensure copies of platform and connector images are available in your custom image registry. [Learn how to set up custom image registries](../deploying-airbyte/integrations/custom-image-registries).

[Custom Docker connectors](../operator-guides/using-custom-connectors/) in your workspace that specify an image using a fully qualified domain name (for example, `example.com/airbyte/your-custom-source`) ignore your configured custom image registry and pull images from the domain specified by that connector.

## üêõ Bug fixes

- **Reduced resource consumption**: Instances of Airbyte running multiple connections at a time now consume fewer resources, thanks to optimizations to the `airbyte-worker` pod.

- **Canceled syncs do not rerun until the next scheduled sync**: If you previously cancelled an in-progress sync, and the next sync as configured in the connection frequency was behind schedule, Airbyte would immediately start a new sync. In practice, many users had to choose to ‚ÄòCancel Sync‚Äô twice in a row to stop moving data.  Airbyte now automatically waits until the next scheduled sync to move data.

- **Reduce rate limit errors from the `airbyte-cron` service**: We fixed an [issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/30691) reported by the community that caused excessive rate limit errors on the `airbyte-cron` pod when users scheduled connections using the Airbyte CRON capability. 

- **Autorecovery for hanging connections**: Airbyte now packages a service to detect connections blocked by the unlikely event that a sync becomes stuck, and remains in a perpetual ‚Äòin-progress‚Äô state without moving data. This heartbeat service will detect syncs that are hanging, and automatically create a new job attempt.
