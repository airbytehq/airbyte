# Airbyte 1.7

People liked the last version of Airbyte so much that we decided to release another one üö¢. Airbyte 1.7 was released on June 10, 2025. We're excited to share new improvements and changes to the Airbyte platform.

## Platform changes

These changes improve Airbyte for everyone.

### Move files and records together

Airbyte now supports moving files and records in the same connection. Some sources, like Google Drive, contain only files. Others, like ZenDesk Support, are mix of structured data and unstructured attachments. In either situation, the combination of structured and unstructured data drives more robust knowledge systems with more context, something critical to successful AI systems.

- In file-based connectors, like S3 or Google Drive, when you choose **Copy raw files** as your delivery method, Airbyte now generates a metadata file describing those files. You control the content of this metadata file when setting up your connection the same way you already select streams.

- In other connectors, like ZenDesk Support, when you set up your connection, you can elect to move attachments as a separate stream in the same connection. In this case, Airbyte also generates a configurable metadata file describing those files.

The following sources support file movement today.

- Zendesk Support
- S3
- Sharepoint
- Google Drive
- SFTP Bulk

Sources only send files this way when the destination supports this. Currently, S3 is the only supported destination.

Airbyte can add more supported connectors based on your greatest need.

### Connector Builder improvements

Airbyte's Connector Builder has new features to ...

#### Stream templates

Stream Templates allow you to generate multiple similar streams from a single template configuration. Stream templates are ideal for APIs that have multiple regions or a large number of resources that have predictable endpoint structures.

#### File syncing

#### Property chunking

#### Multiple response filters

#### Concurrency levels and API budgets

#### More actionable errors in Connector Builder

<!-- At risk, may not be included this time -->

### View and change who configured OAuth

When someone used OAuth to connect to a data source or destination, the connector configuration screen now shows you who the connection runs as. You can also change who this is to avoid a situation where someone leaves your organization and many of your connections fail unexpectedly.

### New API endpoints for check and discover

When you run syncs in Airbyte, the Airbyte protocol cycles through stages before it syncs any data. `Check` validates the configuration of a data source and ensures there are no problems like bad credentials or host names. `Discover` detects and describes the structure of data.

You can now perform these actions asynchronously using Airbyte's public API. [Learn more&nbsp;>](https://reference.airbyte.com)

### Connector Builder off in low resource mode

If you deploy Airbyte with abctl in low resource mode, the Connector Builder is now turned off. To access the Connector Builder, allocate Airbyte's [suggested resources](/platform/next/using-airbyte/getting-started/oss-quickstart#suggested-resources) and re-deploy Airbyte without setting the `--low-resource-mode` flag.

### Contributors: `airbyte-ci` is deprecated

In most cases, the best way to contribute to Marketplace connectors is with Airbyte's Connector Builder, a low-code/no-code development environment inside Airbyte. Some connectors still require using one of Airbyte's connector development kits (CDKs), though.

To simplify and speed up connector development, Airbyte has deprecated the `airbite-ci` tool. 

- Most `airbyte-ci` commands have simpler equivalents in Poe the Poet.

- Airbyte's GitHub repository provides new, more helpful messages in your pull requests.

- Airbyte has removed 8 legacy GitHub workflows that were no longer necessary.

- The new Connector CI suite of checks is between 2 and 10 times faster for rapid iteration with less waiting.

- Maintainers can still manually run connector acceptance tests (CATs üêà) if needed.

Everyone is welcome to contribute to Airbyte. For help developing your own connectors, see [Developing connectors locally](/platform/connector-development/local-connector-development).

<!-- ### Map source fields to destination fields

You can now map source fields to destination fields when creating connections to certain destinations in Airbyte's UI. API destinations and vendors like Salesforce have requirements that data warehouses/lakes don't, like mandatory and optional fields. Currently, this is unlikely to apply to you. But as Airbyte adds new types of destinations beyond traditional data warehouses and data lakes, these abilities are going to become critical to managing the flow of data in your organization. -->

## Self-Managed Enterprise changes

These changes bring new capabilities to Airbyte's Self-Managed Enterprise customers.

:::danger Breaking Change
Before upgrading from version 1.5.1 or earlier, you must upgrade your service account permissions. If you don't, Airbyte doesn't permit you to begin the upgrade. [Learn more&nbsp;>](/platform/enterprise-setup/upgrade-service-account)

### Audit logs

Self-Managed Enterprise now supports audit logging. Audit logging gives you visibility into data, environment, user, and permission changes. This data ensures you have records of any unauthorized changes and insider threats, making it easy to continue meeting your compliance obligations while using Airbyte.

Audit logging requires you to configure a blob storage solution (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage). This bucket must be accessible by Airbyte's pods using the same credentials it uses to access your log and state storage. Then, you configure Airbyte to read from and write to your bucket with Airbyte‚Äôs values.yaml file:

Once enabled, Airbyte writes audit logs to the `/audit-logging/` directory as JSON files named in this format: `<yyyyMMddHHmmss>_<hostname>_<random UUID>`.

```json title="Sample audit log"
{
  "id": "8478fcbd-d369-4bda-8d9b-b782cea5ad40",
  "timestamp": 1746724563299,
  "actor": {
    "actorId": "1c26c465-58h8-43e6-8jko-2252b7g8a9e2",
    "email": "user@airbyte.io",
    "ipAddress": "192.000.000.0",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
  },
  "operation": "deleteWorkspace",
  "request": "<request object>",
  "response": "<response object>",
  "success": true,
  "errorMessage": null
}
```

For help configuring audit logging, see [Audit logging](/platform/next/enterprise-setup/audit-logging).

### Better organization and workspace navigation

If your organization has multiple workspaces, Airbyte's interface features a number of changes that improve navigation and surface meaningful insights about the health of each workspace. Here's what to expect:

- A new organization and workspace picker to easily switch between your workspaces.
- An improved landing page with details about ongoing, successful, and failed syncs.
- Improved navigation in the sidebar to access your organization, workspace, billing, usage details, and user settings.

### Assign data planes from Airbyte's UI

You can now assign a data plane to a workspace from Airbyte's Workspace Settings. Previously, you could only do this with the API.

<!-- ### Single sign on configuration - may not need this as I think the main changes are to Cloud, but will need docs -->
