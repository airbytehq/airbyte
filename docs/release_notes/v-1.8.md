# Airbyte 1.8

It's summer time and that means grilling, fresh air, Coldplay concerts, and a new version of Airbyte. Airbyte 1.8 was released on August 7, 2025. We're excited to share new improvements and changes to the Airbyte platform.

## Platform changes

These changes improve Airbyte for everyone.

If you're upgrading from version 1.6 or earlier, update your ingress so the Connector Builder continues to work. [Learn more](/platform/deploying-airbyte/integrations/ingress-1-7).

### Data activation and reverse ETL (limited roll out)

Airbyte now supports data activation and reverse ETL use cases. Data activation enables you to move data out of your data warehouse and into the operational tools where work happens, like CRMs, marketing platforms, and support systems. With this capability, you can deliver modeled data directly to points of action and systems people already use, helping your organization respond faster and more effectively. Customer IO and HubSpot destinations are already available. [**Learn more >**](/platform/next/move-data/elt-data-activation)

### Major speed improvements (limited roll out)

Airbyte is making major investments into the platform's sync speed. Version 1.8 includes these speed enhancements, but they're not yet widely usable with most connectors. 

To benefit from faster sync speeds, a connection needs to use a source connector _and_ destination connector for which Airbyte has turned on faster syncs. At the time of this release, the MySQL source and S3 destination are turned on. Initial benchmarking from MySQL to S3 has produced sync speeds up to 100 megabytes per second, depending on factors like compute infrastructure and data format. This is many times the old benchmark for this combination of connectors, but it might not be typical of all environments.

Airbyte may enable additional connector combinations as the team works toward general availability. By upgrading to version 1.8, you become eligible to use these faster connections. If you're using the latest connector versions, you might notice increases in sync speed for certain connections. This is Airbyte expanding the roll out. See the change logs for [individual connectors](/integrations/) to see if faster syncs are available.

At a point in the future, we expect to make this technology generally available, and to turn on support for a broad set of connectors. At that time, we'll communicate more about the expected benefits and speed benchmarks.

### Pagination for better UI performance

Airbyte has added pagination to many pages in the user interface. This provides a critical performance boost for workspaces with hundreds or thousands of connections. As you scroll, pages automatically add new data until you reach the end of the list. You can find pagination in the following places:

- The **Sources**, **Destinations**, and **Connections** pages.

- The **source** and **destination** details pages

- The **Define Source** and **Define Destination** pages when setting up a new connection: we've added manual pagination and search bars to make it easier to find existing sources and destinations.

### Updated Connector Builder user interface

We've aligned the Connector Builder's user interface with the YAML specification it represents. You should find it more intuitive to switch between UI and YAML modes. These changes also ensure that virtually all the capabilities of YAML mode are available in the UI. Future new features can be available in the UI at release time, and you no longer need to write YAML to handle most complex APIs.

**Your custom connectors still work normally and migrate seamlessly to the new user interface**. You don't need to take any action. If you need help with any of the fields, see [the documentation](../platform/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/overview).

#### Global configuration

- The **API base URL** and **Authentication method** fields have been removed from this form. You now define URLs and authentication on each stream.

- Use the **Global Configuration** page to control which streams are included in check operations, set concurrency, and adjust request frequency with HTTP budgets.

#### Streams

- **URL path** is removed. The new **API Endpoint URL** field replaces both the **URL path** and the **API base URL** from the Global Configuration. Each stream can now use a different base URL if needed.

- The **Authenticator** panel handles authentication for each stream. Each stream can use a different authentication method if needed. [OAuth 2.0](/platform/using-airbyte/oauth) flows are now fully supported in the Connector Builder, including in asynchronous streams.

- The **Parent Streams** and **Parameterized Requests** panels are now merged into the **Partition Router** panel.

- Added a new **Advanced** panel at the bottom of the page, introducing new capabilities, like file transfers, that were previously only available in YAML mode.

- Renamed or combined some fields to make their purpose more obvious.

### Helm chart V2 is generally available

TBD.

### abctl uses the new Helm chart

TBD. - outline abctl and chart version compatibility.

## Self-Managed Enterprise changes

These changes bring new capabilities to Airbyte's Self-Managed Enterprise customers.

Before upgrading from version 1.5.1 or earlier, upgrade your service account permissions. If you don't, Airbyte doesn't permit you to begin the upgrade. [Learn more&nbsp;>](/platform/enterprise-setup/upgrade-service-account)

### New enterprise destinations

To support Airbyte's data activation capabilities, a new [Salesforce](../integrations/enterprise-connectors/destination-salesforce) destination is available exclusively to enterprise customers for an additional charge.

## Fixes

TBD.
