# February 2024
## airbyte v0.51.0 to v0.56.0

This page includes new features and improvements to the Airbyte Cloud and Airbyte Open Source platforms.

## âœ¨ Highlights

Airbyte now supports **OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO** for Airbyte Enterprise and Airbyte Cloud Teams. This enables companies to use Airbyte with Entra ID/AD via the OIDC protocol.

Airbyte certified our [Microsoft SQL Server source](/integrations/sources/mssql) to support terabyte-sized tables, expanded datetime data types, and reliability improvements.


## Platform Releases

In addition to our OpenID Connect support, we also released: 

- A major upgrade to our Docker and Helm deployments, which simplifies how external logs are configured. Learn more about the specific changes in our [migration guide](/deploying-airbyte/on-kubernetes-via-helm#migrate-from-old-chart-to-airbyte-v0520-and-latest-chart-version).


- Our major version upgrades (Airbyte Cloud only) now only require manual upgrading when you are actively syncing a stream that has changed. Otherwise, syncs will continue as is and the version will be upgraded automatically for you.

## Connector Improvements

In addition to our MS-SQL certification, we also released a few notable Connector improvements:

- We released several connector builder enhancements,including support for raw YAML blocks and the ability to reference custom python components to enable running connectors that use custom components. You can also modify the start date when testing and adjust page/slice/record limits.
- Our [Bing source](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/35812) includes the following new streams: `Audience Performance Report`, `Goals And Funnels Report`, `Product Dimension Performance Report`
- Our [JIRA source](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/35656) now contains more fields to the following streams: `board_issues`,`filter_sharing`,`filters`,`issues`, `permission_schemes`, `sprint_issues`,`users_groups_detailed` and `workflows` 
- Our [Snapchat Source](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/35660) now contains additional fields in the `ads`, `adsquads`, `creatives`, and `media` streams.
