# Airbyte 1.5.0

Punxsutawney Phil `[did/didn't]` see his shadow. `[Spring is coming!/Looks like winter's here to stay]`, but the latest Airbyte release is `[even more/something]` to look forward to. Airbyte 1.5.0 was released on Febraury 6, 2025. Weâ€™re excited to share new improvements and changes to the Airbyte platform.

## ðŸš€ Self-Managed Enterprise Changes

These changes bring new capabilities to Airbyte's Self-Managed Enterprise customers.

### Mappings in the UI

We introduced mappings into the API in version 1.3, and it's now available in Airbyte's user interface, too.

Itâ€™s often the case that you want to move data from a source to a destination in a non-literal way, obscuring sensitive information and improving the consistency and usability of that data in its final destination. Mapping allows you to match a field from your source to your destination and sync data in a way that is still accurate, but also more meaningful and appropriate for your needs. Use mappings to hash, encrypt, and rename fields, and filter rows. You set up mappings on each stream, ensuring your source data arrives in your destination exactly as you want it.

### Audit logging for role-based access control (RBAC) permissions changes

Self-Managed Enterprise now supports audit logging. This initial release focuses on providing you with full visibility into permission changes. This data will ensure you have records of any unauthorized changes and insider threats, making it easy to continue meeting your compliance obligations while using Airbyte.

Audit logging requires you to configure a blob storage solution (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage). This bucket must be accessible by Airbyte's pods using the same credentials it uses to access your log and state storage. It's easiest to reuse your existing bucket, but you can create a new bucket as long as the [authentication is identical](../enterprise-setup/implementation-guide#configuring-external-logging).

Then, you configure Airbyte to read from and write to your bucket with Airbyteâ€™s `values.yaml` file:

```yml title="values.yaml"
server:
  env_vars:
    AUDIT_LOGGING_ENABLED: true
    STORAGE_BUCKET_AUDIT_LOGGING: # your-audit-logging-bucket
```

Once enabled, audit logs are written to the `/audit-logging/` directory as JSON files. These files have the following naming convention: `<yyyyMMddHHmmss>_<hostname>_<random UUID>`. 

## ðŸš€ Platform Changes

These changes improve Airbyte for all Self-Managed users.

### OAuth 2.0 support in the connector builder



### Connection tags

You can now classify your connections by creating, editing, applying, and deleting tags. This popular classification tool gives you the power to organize connections based on any set of criteria you like, and then search for or filter connections so you only see the ones you're interested in.
