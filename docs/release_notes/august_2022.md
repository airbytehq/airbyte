# August 2022
## Airbyte [v0.39.42-alpha](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/releases/tag/v0.39.42-alpha) to [v0.40.3](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/releases/tag/v0.40.3)

This page includes new features and improvements to the Airbyte Cloud and Airbyte Open Source platforms.

### New features
* Added reserved keywords for schema names by fixing the quotation logic in normalization. [#14683](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/14683)

* Added [documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/cloud/managing-airbyte-cloud/review-sync-summary) about the data displayed in sync log summaries. [#15181](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/15181)

* Added OAuth login to Airbyte Cloud, which allows you to sign in using your Google login credentials. [#15414](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/15414)

    * You can use your Google login credentials to sign in to your Airbyte account if they share the same email address.  

    * You can create a new Airbyte account with OAuth using your Google login credentials. 

    * You cannot use OAuth to log in if you are invited to join a workspace.

### Improvements
* Improved the Airbyte version naming conventions by removing the `-alpha` tag. The Airbyte platform is used successfully by thousands of users, so the `-alpha` tag is no longer necessary. [#15766](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/15766)

* Improved the `loadBalancerIP` in the web app by making it configurable. [#14992](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/14992)

* Datadog:

    * Improved the Airbyte platform by supporting StatsD, which sends Temporal metrics to Datadog. [#14842](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/14842)

    * Added Datadog tags to help you identify metrics between Airbyte instances. [#15213](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/15213) 

    * Added metric client tracking to record schema validation errors. [#13393](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/13393)

### Bugs
* Fixed an issue where data types did not display correctly in the UI. The correct data types are now displayed in the streams of your connections. [#15558](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/15558)

* Fixed an issue where requests would fail during a release by adding a shutdown hook to the Airbyte server. This ensures the requests will be gracefully terminated before they can fail. [#15934](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/15934)

* Helm charts:

    * Fixed the deployment problems of the Helm chart with FluxCD by removing unconditional resource assignment in the chart for Temporal. [#15374](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/15374)

    * Fixed the following issues in [#15199](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/15199):

        * Fixed an issue where `toyaml` was being used instead of `toYaml`, which caused Helm chart installation to fail.

        * Fixed incorrect `extraContainers` indentation, which caused Helm chart installation to fail if the value was supplied.

        * Fixed incorrect Postgres secret reference and made it more user friendly.

        * Updated the method of looking up secrets and included an override feature to protect users from common mistakes.
