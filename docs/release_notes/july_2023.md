## **✨ New and improved features**

- **New Sources and Promotions**: July has been a month of expansion and innovation for us. We've rolled out several new connectors and promotions to enhance our offerings. One of the significant additions is the **[Datadog connector](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/27906)** to the cloud, which promises to streamline data integration from Datadog. Another noteworthy introduction is the destination for **[Vector Database powered by LangChain](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/26184)**, a powerful database solution. We've also ventured into new territories with the introduction of the **[Gainsight-px source](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/26998)**. Additionally, our commitment to keeping our tools updated is reflected in the upgrade of the **[Iceberg destination](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/23201)**.
- **New Features for Existing Connectors**: Our existing connectors have received a lot of love this month. We've made OAuth the exclusive option for **[Shopify-Oauth](https://chat.openai.com/c/e3dcdfa7-a2d3-46b5-9976-2bb866e1bb2a#6457)**, enhancing security and simplifying the authentication process. The **[Datadog source](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/27804)** now supports multiple query streams, offering more flexibility in data retrieval. We've also enriched our **[Twilio](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/27231)** and **[Zendesk Support](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/27156)** connectors with new streams, broadening the scope of data that can be accessed. Furthermore, several sources have been migrated to advanced authentication, reinforcing security and streamlining the user experience.
- **New Features in Airbyte Platform**: On the platform front, we've introduced aesthetic and functional enhancements. Users can now enjoy a visually pleasing **[Dark Mode](https://chat.openai.com/c/e3dcdfa7-a2d3-46b5-9976-2bb866e1bb2a#6632)**, reducing eye strain during extended usage. We've also made it easier to manage data synchronization with the addition of a **[sync mode dropdown](https://chat.openai.com/c/e3dcdfa7-a2d3-46b5-9976-2bb866e1bb2a#7688)** in the stream details panel. For those building connectors, the new **[global requests UI](https://chat.openai.com/c/e3dcdfa7-a2d3-46b5-9976-2bb866e1bb2a#7699)** in the Connector Builder promises a more intuitive experience.

## **🚨 Security & Breaking changes**

The incremental for the **[Hubspot engagement stream](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/27161)** has been fixed, ensuring accurate data retrieval. We've also taken the step to remove the **`Activity`** Stream from **[MetaBase](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/27777)** for optimization.
