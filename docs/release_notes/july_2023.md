## **‚ú® New and improved features**

- **New Sources and Promotions**: July has been a month of expansion and innovation for us. We've rolled out several new connectors and promotions to enhance our offerings. One of the significant additions is the **[Datadog connector](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/27906)** to the cloud, which promises to streamline data integration from Datadog. Another noteworthy introduction is the destination for **[Vector Database powered by LangChain](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/26184)**, a powerful database solution. We've also ventured into new territories with the introduction of the **[Gainsight-px source](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/26998)**. Additionally, our commitment to keeping our tools updated is reflected in the upgrade of the **[Iceberg destination](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/23201)**.
- **New Features for Existing Connectors**: Our existing connectors have received a lot of love this month. We've made OAuth the exclusive option for **[Shopify-Oauth](https://chat.openai.com/c/e3dcdfa7-a2d3-46b5-9976-2bb866e1bb2a#6457)**, enhancing security and simplifying the authentication process. The **[Datadog source](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/pull/27804)** now supports multiple query streams, offering more flexibility in data retrieval.

Furthermore, several sources have been migrated to advanced authentication, reinforcing security and streamlining the user experience.

Users can now enjoy a visually pleasing **[Dark Mode](https://chat.openai.com/c/e3dcdfa7-a2d3-46b5-9976-2bb866e1bb2a#6632)**, reducing eye strain during extended usage. We've also made it easier to manage data synchronization with the addition of a **[sync mode dropdown](https://chat.openai.com/c/e3dcdfa7-a2d3-46b5-9976-2bb866e1bb2a#7688)** in the stream details panel. For those building connectors, the new **[global requests UI](https://chat.openai.com/c/e3dcdfa7-a2d3-46b5-9976-2bb866e1bb2a#7699)** in the Connector Builder promises a more intuitive experience.
