# Deploy Airbyte

Deploying Airbyte Open-Source just takes two steps.

1. Install Docker on your workstation \(see [instructions](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)\). Make sure you're on the latest version of `docker-compose`.
2. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git
cd airbyte
./run-ab-platform.sh 
```

Once you see an Airbyte banner, the UI is ready to go at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)! You will be asked for a username and password. By default, that's username `airbyte` and password `password`. Once you deploy airbyte to your servers, **be sure to change these** in your `.env` file.

Alternatively, if you have an Airbyte Cloud invite, just follow [these steps.](../deploying-airbyte/on-cloud.md)
