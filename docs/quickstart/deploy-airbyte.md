# Deploy Airbyte

* Install Docker on your workstation \(see [instructions](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)\). Note: There is a known issue with docker-compose 1.27.3. If you are using that version, please upgrade to 1.27.4.
* After Docker is installed, you can immediately get started locally by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git
cd airbyte
docker-compose up
```

* Once you see an Airbyte banner, the UI is ready to go at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)!
