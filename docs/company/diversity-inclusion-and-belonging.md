# Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging

In addition to our strong personal feelings for a better future of work, we believe there is a strong correlation between highly diverse teams and [performance](https://www.ucdenver.edu/docs/librariesprovider68/default-document-library/jmna-articles-bonuscontent-2.pdf?Status=Temp&sfvrsn=84c0fb9_2) + creativity. Having diverse perspectives on a problem enriches all perspectives on it. So, at Airbyte, we see diversity and inclusion as a prerequisite for our success. We feel humbled every day by the active community that gives us new perspectives to consider every day. 

We want to commoditize data integration for every company in the world. How could we  achieve that if the perspectives we consider are incomplete?

## Some Definitions

We feel it is important to have a common understanding of what these terms are. 

**Diversity** refers to the characteristics and traits that make people unique and different. While there are an infinite number of differences in humans, most people subconsciously define diversity by categories including gender, race and age.

**Inclusion** refers to the behaviors and social norms that make people feel welcome. It includes everyone being treated fairly and with respect. It ensures that everyone has equal access to opportunities and is able to contribute fully to the company’s success.

**Belonging** refers to the feeling that makes people feel part of the community. It includes the feeling of being heard and valued. 

We are aware that diversity, inclusion and belonging efforts are a lifelong work. It will always be an ongoing priority for us. We are aware that we will make mistakes, but know that the important thing is that we learn from them. At Airbyte, everyone is committed to building a culture of diversity, inclusivity and belonging.

Individuals who are most often underrepresented in the tech and startup communities tend to be those who identify as:

* A person of color
* Indigenous
* Women
* Members of the LGBTQ+ community
* Being from a working-class background
* Those who struggle with mental illnesses
* Having a disability, whether visible or not

## An Inclusive Place to Work

At Airbyte, we are by no means perfect, but we are committed to acting with positive intent and pushing ourselves to improve. We will always want to learn and improve our culture to make it as inclusive as possible. 

This is not just a statement for us. Here are some of the things we've implemented so far:

* **Fully** [**remote**](remote-processes.md) - so we have access to a huge, global hiring pool. We have people in ~6 countries, with no office. 
* **Asynchronous and transparent communication** - so our teams can work together effectively on their own schedule no matter their location or time zone.
* \*\*\*\*[**Unlimited vacation policy**](../people/benefits.md) with a minimum expected time off that allows you to schedule your work around your life.
* \*\*\*\*[**Parental leave**](../people/time-off.md#parental-leave) **\(for both parents\)** - so you have time to adjust to the new life \(and work\) schedule introduced by your new bundle of joy.
* \*\*\*\*[**Transparent salary philosophy**](../people/compensation.md#salary-calculator) to eliminate salary negotiation and avoid wage gaps.
* Multi-channel sourcing for recruitments in order to encourage **underrepresented groups of people to apply** - so we are meeting with a balanced group of applicants for every role. 
* **Mental Health Counseling** administered through our partner [Spill](https://www.spill.chat/).
* **Collaborative employee handbook** - anyone can contribute to this [handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook/) through a pull request. If we have overlooked anything in our policy, our members can easily request changes.
