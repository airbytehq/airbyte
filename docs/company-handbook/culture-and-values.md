# Culture and Values

Culture & values are not a pretty words on a wall. They are the dimensions by which we hire, we promote, and we demote.

We hope the handbook will help you better understand how it feels to work with us as a colleague, a client, a partner or a member of our open source community.

We also believe that a company culture needs to be opinionated to be effective and attract the right people. It cannot be right for every person, or it would mean we don’t have a culture. And that’s perfectly fine. We will continue to iterate and refine our values along the way.

Here are the values we deeply believe in:

## **Transparency and Candor**

We’re huge believers in “Diversity in counsel, unity in action.” Several heads are always better than one head to solve any problem. The more diverse the views, the more enlightened the decision will be. This entails several things:

* For any collaboration to be fruitful, we need **full transparency**. Any missing information is a risk. 
* **Any opinion or concern needs to be shared**. Saying “I knew it would turn out like this…” is not acceptable if you didn't share your view beforehand. 
* We always share our challenges: **bad news must travel faster than good news.**

However, “unity in action” means for us that **we don’t believe in consensus**, and that even if you don’t believe in the decision that was made, you must commit to it and give it a chance to succeed. Consensus results in diluted solutions.

## **Humility and Maximizing Growth**

Candid collaboration can’t work without humility. Humility means that you’re open minded towards others’ opinions, and let others speak their minds, whatever their role.

Leaving ego at the door means you don't defend a point just to win an argument. We are a team **in search of truth, not in search of winning points**.

We prioritize **progress over perfection**. We are thankful towards errors of action, provided we learn and get better.

We should **never pull rank**. If you have to remind someone of your position, you're doing something wrong. Explain the reasons for your decision, and respect everyone irrespective of their function.

We **leverage our time**, and we enable others to leverage their time:

* We stay away from low impact tasks. If they exist, we question their existence, and we kill them, we automate them or we externalize them. 
* We are never a blocker. We respond to ALL communications \(internal or external\) within 12h.
* We stay critical about past decisions and existing processes \("Is this meeting really useful?"\) .

## **Being Intentional and Owning the Outcome**

We always want to stay mindful about the projects we are working on, and why we are working on them. We need to understand the value we expect to bring, the audience we want to address, and the metrics we want to impact.

If we see some great changes in metrics, we need to understand why. **We don’t take things for granted.**

We expect team members to complete tasks that they are assigned. **Having a task means you are responsible for anticipating and solving problems.** As an owner, you are responsible for overcoming challenges, not your suppliers or other team members. Take the initiative and proactively inform stakeholders when there is something you might not be able to solve.

## **Trust and Caring**

All of this can only work if you can feel comfortable being vulnerable with your colleagues; you must be able to trust them.

**Constructive feedback should be on a one-on-one basis.** If you are unhappy with anything, please let the other person know as soon as you realize it. It doesn’t matter what their role is. We want to solve problems while they are small.

**Assume positive intent.** We assume that people have the best intentions, so we assume the positive interpretation of behaviors and feedback, as opposed to the negative one. We think of mistakes as the tuition for learning.

**Address behavior, not people.** For constructive feedback to work, it should not be tied to the individual.

**Don't let others fail, if you can help.** We succeed together. We keep an eye out for others who may be struggling or stuck, and see how we can provide assistance when needed.
