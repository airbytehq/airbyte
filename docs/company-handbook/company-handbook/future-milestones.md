# Story

Dataline was founded by Michel and John in December 2019. 

Our first idea was to help companies exchange data, starting by building a customer portal for data providers so their clients can easily evaluate and pull data however and wherever they want. 

During our time at YC, we pivoted to a data unblocking product which allowed website owners to get 100% of their customer traffic data for analytics, even when visitors are using ad blockers. The product was getting good traction until COVID-19 hit, and marketing priorities shifted, making this product a nice-to-have rather than a must. So we decided to go back to our roots, making moving data easy. 

There are more and more data products out there, event-based customer data pipelines a la Segment and batch data ingestion pipelines a la Fivetran. Both entail moving your data out of your infrastructure. From our past experience, this is becoming a problem for more and more companies. Because companies won’t let a third party access, let alone move, their data, engineers must develop and maintain these connections themselves.

That’s why we decided to build Dataline, a new self-hosted, open-source data integration engine. 

Open sourcing the core engine is a prerequisite to building a top class engine so that anyone can add their own integrations and extend the project with the features that serve their use cases. 

And that’s how we started!
