# Strategy

## **Our focus**

We want to become the self-hosted data integration and transformation engine that most companies use in the future. This implies that our open-source technology will support:

* both batch-based and streaming-based data integrations
* both ingestion to warehouses from any tool, database or SaaS, and distribution of data to any SaaS tools.

On top of that, we will build data quality monitoring, privacy compliance \(GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc\), and enterprise features \(role access / management, SSO, etc.\).

Eventually, you should be able to build your own Segment and Fivetran platform internally, while having complete control over your data and costs \(not indexed on MTUs\). 

We will stay at parity with the incumbent’s features \(Segment, Fivetran\) at first, as our differentiation is on:

* open source
* data privacy and control
* fixed pricing \(not indexed on data volume or monthly active users\). 

## **Our differentiation**

There are a few key differentiating aspects to our strategy:

* Our core product is free to use, open source, and extensible by anybody who can code. 
* We have a zero-friction adoption in small, midsize and big companies, as you don’t need to go through security compliance to start implementing our solution.
* We will be able to offer a wide array of data integration products, as GitLab did for CI/CD, letting the community fill in the gaps. If an integration is missing, it is dead simple to add it, and you don’t need to wait for someone else's engineering team to prioritize it.
* Your data stays in your cloud, which means it is more secure.
* Our pricing will not be indexed on data volume and can better fit with enterprises’ context. And our open-source codebase will never contain arbitrary limits \(e.g., event volumes, user numbers\).

## **Our financing strategy**

### **Seed in Q2 2020**

We raised $1.8M in a seed round that gives us a runway until mid 2022. We will focus on the community edition until the Series-A. The metrics we will display to investors will be on adoption, deployments, and external contributions.

It is completely fine for us not to present any revenues before the Series-A. 

### **Series-A by Q1 2022**

We will build out and release the enterprise edition only after the Series-A. It is paramount that we continue to support the community edition so it:

* remains the most reliable option with an active community
* offers the highest number of integrations, sources and destinations. 

## **Our hiring strategy**

Our team is composed of 4 engineering leaders, all from one of the highest-growing data companies in the world. We have already built 500+ integrations in the past on high-scale volume projects. This is why we can afford our ambitious technological goals. 

We are working closely with a contractor on the frontend side and are doing all the UI design specs in-house for the moment. 

Until the Series-A, we will stay lean. But if we ever hire a person, it will be a 5th A-player data engineer, as our focus is only on what is key to our company: data engineering.
