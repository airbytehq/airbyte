# Roadmap

We foresee several high-level phases in our roadmap that we will try to share here. 

## **1. Parity on data consolidation in warehouses**

Our first focus is to support batch-type ingestion integrations. We feel that we can provide value right away as soon as we support one of the integrations you need. Batch integrations are also easier to build and sustain. So we would rather start with that. 

Before we move on to the next phase, we want to make sure we are supporting all the major integrations and that we are in a state where we can address the long tail, with the help of the community.

## **2. Data distribution from warehouses**

Some integrations we have in mind are batch distribution integrations, from warehouses to third-party tools. For instance, a use case could be if your marketing team wants to send back the data to your ad platforms, so it can better optimize the campaigns. Another use case could be syncing the consolidated data back to your CRM. 

It’s not yet clear in our minds when to prioritize those additional integrations. We will have a better idea once we see the feedback we get from the community we build with data consolidation. 

## **3. Parity with privacy compliance and customer data consolidation features** 

Hopefully, we will have raised a Series-A by then, so we can start focusing on the enterprise edition’s features, in addition to pursuing efforts on addressing the long tail of integrations. 

## **4. Expand on all data engineering features**

This is when we will start differentiating ourselves in terms of feature coverage with current cloud-based incumbents. Being open-sourced enables us to go faster, but also deeper. 

We are also thinking about supporting streaming-type integrations, a la Segment.
