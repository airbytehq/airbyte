# Company Handbook

Welcome to our company handbook.

This is where you will find all information about Airbyte, its story, culture, strategy, roadmap, and how to contribute.

Transparency is one of our core values, which is why we make this handbook public.

We believe the best ideas and solutions come from a place where people trust each other. And trust is built on transparency.

We also see transparency as a way for us to involve the community in the problem we’re solving. And we hope you’ll trust us and our mission.

If you have any questions or are interested in joining us in our mission, please don’t hesitate to ping us at [hey@airbyte.io](mailto:hey@airbyte.io).

This handbook will grow with us, as we’ll try to keep it up-to-date as much as possible.
