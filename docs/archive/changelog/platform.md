## [03-08-2021 - 0.17](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/releases/tag/v0.17.0-alpha)

* Add a prefix for tables, so that tables with the same name don't clobber each other in the destination

## [03-01-2021 - 0.16](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/milestone/22?closed=1)

* We made some progress to address **nested tables in our normalization.**

  Previously, basic normalization would output nested tables as-is and append a number for duplicate tables. For example, Stripe’s nested address fields go from:

  ```text
  Address
  address_1
  ```

  To

  ```text
  Charges_source_owner_755_address
  customers_shipping_c70_address
  ```

  After the change, the parent tables are combined with the name of the nested table to show where the nested table originated. **This is a breaking change for the consumers of nested tables. Consumers will need to update to point at the new tables.**

## [02-19-2021 - 0.15](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/milestone/22?closed=1)

* We now handle nested tables with the normalization steps. Check out the video below to see how it works.
