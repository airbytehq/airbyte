# Upgrade to Helm chart V2 (Self-Managed Community)

Airbyte has upgraded its Helm chart to a new version called "V2." Using Helm chart V2 is currently optional. At some future date the V2 Helm chart will become the standard, so we advise that you upgrade your existing deployment to use the new chart before the transition. If you're a new Airbyte customer, you can skip the upgrade altogether and start with the new chart.

:::important Enterprise customers
Follow the [Self-Managed Enterprise guide](../enterprise-setup/chart-v2-enterprise) instead.

## Why you should upgrade

Upgrading to the new Helm chart now has the following benefits.

1. By upgrading in advance, you can schedule this upgrade for a convenient time. Avoid blocking yourself from upgrading Airbyte to a future version when the new chart is mandatory and you're busy.

2. The new Helm chart is more aligned with Helm's best practices for chart design.

3. The new Helm chart has broader and more detailed options to customize your deployment. In most cases, it's no longer necessary to specify environment variables in your `values.yaml` file because the chart offers a more detailed interface for customization. If you do need to use environment variables, you can use fewer of them.

## Which versions can upgrade to Helm chart V2

The following versions of Airbyte can use Helm chart V2:

- Airbyte version 1.6.0 and later, if installed and managed with Helm _and_ connected to an external database and external storage bucket

The following versions of Airbyte _can't_ use Helm chart V2:

- Airbyte versions before 1.6.0

- Airbyte versions installed and managed with abctl

- Airbyte versions that aren't connected to an external database and storage bucket

:::danger
Don't migrate to Helm chart V2 if you haven't set up an external database and storage. These resources contain the data your Airbyte deployment needs to operate and a fresh deployment won't work without them. Airbyte is evaluating possible migration paths for open source deployments that don't meet this requirement.

## How to upgrade

In most cases, upgrading is straightforward. To upgrade to Helm chart V2, you complete the following steps.

1. Ensure you have configured Airbyte to use an external database and external bucket storage.

2. Prepare to deploy a fresh installation of Airbyte.

3. Create a new `values.yaml` file.

4. Deploy a new version of Airbyte using your new `values.yaml` file and the new Helm chart version.

<!-- ### Configure external database and bucket storage -->

<!-- This might be a non-starter for community. Can we reasonably ask them to do this? -->

<!-- Although Airbyte provides its own basic database and storage, most people opt to use their own. If you don't already do this, you must enable these before migrating.

- [Configure an external database](integrations/database)
- [Configure external storage](integrations/storage) -->

### Prepare a fresh deployment of Airbyte

When moving to Helm chart V2, deploy Airbyte with a new namespace and use a fresh values and secrets file. It is possible to do a straight upgrade, but different Airbyte users have different and sometimes complex configurations that could produce unique and unexpected situations during the upgrade. By doing a fresh install, you create a separate environment that's easier to troubleshoot if something in your values or secrets files acts unexpectedly.

### Add V2 chart repo

Helm chart V2 uses a different repo URL than V1 did. In your command line tool, add this repo and index it.

```bash
# Helm chart V1
# helm repo add airbyte https://airbytehq.github.io/helm-charts

# Helm chart V2
helm repo add airbyte-v2 https://airbytehq.github.io/charts
helm repo update
```

You can browse all charts uploaded to your repository.

```bash
helm search repo airbyte-v2
```

### Update your values.yaml file

In most cases, the adjustments to `values.yaml` are small and involve changing keys and moving sections. This section walks you through the main updates you need to make. If you already know what to do, see [Values.yaml reference](../deploying-airbyte/values) for the full V1 and V2 interfaces.

Airbyte recommends approaching this project in this way:

1. Note the customizations in your V1 `values.yaml` file to ensure you don't forget anything.

2. Start with a basic V2 `values.yaml` to verify that it works. Map your V1 settings to V2, transferring one set of configurations at a time.

3. Don't test in production.

Follow the steps below to start generating `values.yaml`.

<details>
<summary>
Create a `values.yaml` file and a `global` configuration
</summary>

Create a new `values.yaml` file on your machine. In that file, create your basic global configuration.

```yaml title="values.yaml"
global:
  edition: community

  airbyteUrl: "" # The URL where Airbyte will be reached; This should match your Ingress host
```

Optional: [deploy Airbyte](#deploy-airbyte) before you add additional configurations. If there are issues with your deployment, troubleshooting them is easier before you integrate additional services.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Add your database
</summary>

Disable Airbyte's default Postgres database and add your own. The main difference in Helm chart V2 is the `global.database.database` key has changed to `global.database.name`.

```yaml title="values.yaml"
global: 
  database:
    # -- Secret name where database credentials are stored
    secretName: "" # e.g. "airbyte-config-secrets"
    # -- The database host
    host: ""
    # -- The database port
    port:
    # -- The database name - this key used to be "database" in Helm chart 1.0
    name: ""

    # Use EITHER user or userSecretKey, but not both
    # -- The database user
    user: ""
    # -- The key within `secretName` where the user is stored
    userSecretKey: "" # e.g. "database-user"

    # Use EITHER password or passwordSecretKey, but not both
    # -- The database password
    password: ""
    # -- The key within `secretName` where the password is stored
    passwordSecretKey: "" # e.g."database-password"

postgresql:
  enabled: false
```

<summary>
Add external logging
</summary>

```yaml
global:
  storage:
    secretName: ""
    type: minio # default storage is minio. Set to s3, gcs, or azure, according to what you use.

    bucket:
      log: airbyte-bucket
      auditLogging: airbyte-bucket # Version 1.7 or later, only if you're using audit logging
      state: airbyte-bucket
      workloadOutput: airbyte-bucket
      activityPayload: airbyte-bucket

    # Set ONE OF the following storage types, according to your specification above

    # S3
    s3:
      region: "" ## e.g. us-east-1
      authenticationType: credentials ## Use "credentials" or "instanceProfile"
      accessKeyId: ""
      secretAccessKey: ""

    # GCS
    gcs:
      projectId: <project-id>
      credentialsJson:  <base64-encoded>
      credentialsJsonPath: /secrets/gcs-log-creds/gcp.json

    # Azure
    azure:
      # one of the following: connectionString, connectionStringSecretKey
      connectionString: <azure storage connection string>
      connectionStringSecretKey: <secret coordinate containing an existing connection-string secret>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Add external connector secret management
</summary>

```yaml
global:
  secretsManager:
    enabled: false
    type: "" # one of: VAULT, GOOGLE_SECRET_MANAGER, AWS_SECRET_MANAGER, AZURE_KEY_VAULT, TESTING_CONFIG_DB_TABLE
    secretName: "airbyte-config-secrets"

    # Set ONE OF the following groups of configurations, based on your configuration in global.secretsManager.type.

    awsSecretManager:
      region: <aws-region>
      authenticationType: credentials ## Use "credentials" or "instanceProfile"
      tags: ## Optional - You may add tags to new secrets created by Airbyte.
      - key: ## e.g. team
          value: ## e.g. deployments
        - key: business-unit
          value: engineering
      kms: ## Optional - ARN for KMS Decryption.

    # OR

    googleSecretManager:
      projectId: <project-id>
      credentialsSecretKey: gcp.json

    # OR

    azureKeyVault:
      tenantId: ""
      vaultUrl: ""
      clientId: ""
      clientIdSecretKey: ""
      clientSecret: ""
      clientSecretSecretKey: ""
      tags: ""

    # OR

    vault:
      address: ""
      prefix: ""
      authToken: ""
      authTokenSecretKey: ""
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Update syntax for other customizatons
</summary>

If you have further customizations in your V1 values.yaml file, move those over to your new values.yaml file, and update key names where appropriate.

- Change hyphenated V1 keys keys to camel case in V2. For example, when copying over `workload-launcher`, change it to `workloadLauncher`.

- Some keys have different names. For example, `orchestrator` is `containerOrchestrator` in V2.

Here is the full list of changes.

<details>
<summary>
Convert `extraEnv` variables
</summary>

In previous versions of your values.yaml file, you might have specified a number of environment variables through `extraEnv`. Many (but not all) of these variables have a dedicated interface in Helm chart V2. For example, look at the following configuration, which tells `workload-launcher` to run pods in the `jobs` node group.

```yaml title="values.yaml using Helm chart V1"
workload-launcher:
  nodeSelector:
    type: static
  ## Pods spun up by the workload launcher will run in the 'jobs' node group.
  extraEnv:
    - name: JOB_KUBE_NODE_SELECTORS
      value: type=jobs
    - name: SPEC_JOB_KUBE_NODE_SELECTORS
      value: type=jobs
    - name: CHECK_JOB_KUBE_NODE_SELECTORS
      value: type=jobs
    - name: DISCOVER_JOB_KUBE_NODE_SELECTORS
      value: type=jobs
```

You can specify these values directly without using environment variables, achieving the same effect.

```yaml title="values.yaml using Helm chart V2"
global:
  jobs:
    kube:
      nodeSelector:
        type: jobs
      scheduling:
        check:
          nodeSelectors:
            type: jobs
        discover:
          nodeSelectors:
            type: jobs
        spec:
          nodeSelectors:
            type: jobs

workloadLauncher:
  nodeSelector:
    type: static
```

### Deploy Airbyte {#deploy-airbyte}

Before you deploy, validate your values.yaml file.

```bash
helm template airbyte airbyte-v2/airbyte --values ./values.yaml --version 2.0.3 > /dev/null
```

Here is an example of how to deploy version 1.7.0 of Airbyte using the latest Helm chart V2 values. Normally the Helm chart version is identical to the Airbyte version. Since using this chart version is optional, the Helm chart and Airbyte have different, but compatible, versions.

```bash
helm upgrade airbyte airbyte-v2/airbyte \
  --namespace airbyte-v2 \       # Target Kubernetes namespace
  --values ./values.yaml \       # Custom configuration values
  --version 2.0.3 \              # Helm chart version to use
  --set global.image.tag=1.7.0   # Airbyte version to use
```

<!-- I am realizing the decoupling the chart from the platform may create weird scenarios where it's unclear which version/chart combination to use. -->
