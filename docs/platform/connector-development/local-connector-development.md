# Developing Connectors Locally

This document outlines the tools needed to develop connectors locally, and how to use each tool.

When developing connectors locally, you'll want to ensure the following tools are installed:

1. [**Poe the Poet**](#poe-the-poet) - Used as a common task interface for defining and running development tasks.
1. [`docker`](#docker) - Used when building and running connector container images.
1. [`airbyte-ci`](#airbyte-ci) - Used for a large number of tasks such as building and publishing.
1. [`gradle`](#gradle) - Required when working with Java and Kotlin connectors.

## Poe the Poet

[Poe the Poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io/installation.html#) - This tool allows you to perform common connector tasks from a single entrypoint.

To see a list of available tasks, run `poe` from any directory in the `airbyte` repo.

Notes:

1. When running `poe` from the root of the repo, you'll have the options `connector`, `source`, and `destination`. These will each pass the tasks you request along to the specified connector's directory.
2. When running `poe` from a connector directory, you'll get a specific list of available tasks, like `lint`, `check-all`, etc. The available commands may vary by connector and connector type (java vs python vs manifest-only), so run `poe` on its own to see what commands are available.
3. Poe tasks are there to help you, but they are _not_ the only way to run a task. Please feel encouraged to review, copy, paste, or combing steps from the task definitions in the `poe_tasks` directory. And if you find task invocation patterns that are especially helpful, please consider contributing back to those task definition files by creating a new PR.

:::tip

You can find the global Poe task definitions for any connector in the `poe_tasks` directory at the root of the Airbyte repo. These definitions can be a helpful reference if you want to decompose or combine certain tasks to suite your preference or to plug these commands natively into your IDE of choice.

## Docker

We recommend Docker Desktop but other container runtimes might be available. A full discussion of how to install and use docker is outside the scope of this guide.

See [Debugging Docker](./debugging-docker.md) for common tips and tricks.

## airbyte-ci

Airbyte CI `(airbyte-ci`) is a Dagger-based tool for accomplishing specific tasks. See `airbyte-ci --help` for a list of commands you can run.

## Gradle

Gradle is used in Java and Kotlin development.  A full discussion of how to install and use docker is outside the scope of this guide. Similar to running `poe`, you can run `gradle tasks` to view a list of available Gradle development tasks.

:::tip

You can also use `poe` to execute Gradle tasks, often with less typing. From within a connector directory you can run `poe gradle tasks` for a list of Gradle tasks that apply to the connector and `poe gradle TASK_NAME` to run a given Gradle task for that connector.

Using this syntax you can avoid the long task prefixes such as typing `gradle :integration-tests:connectors:source-mysource:unitTest` and instead run `poe gradle unitTest` within the connector directory.
