# Organizations and workspaces

Organizations and workspaces are the highest levels of structure in Airbyte. They're the primary ways you segregate data and connections, manage access, and control billing.

If you use Self-Managed Community or Cloud Standard, you only have one organization and one workspace. For Self-Managed Community, these concepts aren't relevant. For Cloud Standard users, you can upgrade to Pro or Enterprise Flex to access multiple workspaces.
