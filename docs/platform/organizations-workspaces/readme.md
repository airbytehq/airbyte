# Organizations and workspaces

Organizations and workspaces are the highest levels of structure in Airbyte. They're the primary ways you segregate data and connections, manage access, and control billing.

If you use Self-Managed Community, you only have one organization and one workspace, so these concepts aren't relevant to you.
