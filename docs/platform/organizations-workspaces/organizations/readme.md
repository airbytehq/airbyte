# Organizations

The highest level of structure in Airbyte is an **organization**. Organizations are how you manage membership and permissions, billing (if applicable), and overall account usage.

Self-Managed deployments only have one organization, but you can deploy Airbyte multiple times to establish different organizations.

Organizations contain one or more [workspaces](../workspaces). From your organization's home page, you can view all of your workspaces and the current status of all syncs. Use this ability to identify workspaces with failed syncs that might need your attention.

Each organization is unrelated to all others. Most Airbyte users belong to a single organization, but some people belong to multiple organizations. For example, a consultant working with multiple companies might have access to multiple Airbyte organizations.
