# Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role Based Access Control allows a user with Administrative access to apply roles to users, granting different levels of permission within an Organization or Workspace. 

:::info
**Self-Managed Enterprise** instances have an `Instance Admin` role in addition to the other roles outlined in this document. The first user who logs on to Airbyte in a Self-Managed Enterprise instance will be assigned this role. This user will have all permissions listed below for all workspaces and all organizations associated with their Enterprise account. To update this assignment, enterprise customers should contact [Airbyte support](https://support.airbyte.com/hc/en-us).

## Setting Roles

<Arcade id="pYZ3aHWlV4kJatJG2dJN" title="Organization Permissions" paddingBottom="calc(61.37931034482759% + 41px)" />

1. In the navigation bar, click **Workspace settings** or **Organization settings** > **Members**.

2. In the table, under **Workspace role**, click the current role and then select a new role.

    - You can't demote admins.

    - If you're assigning roles in a workspace, you can't assign a role that's more restricted than the role that person holds in the organization. For example, an organization admin must also be a workspace admin. However, an organization reader can be a workspace reader, editor, or admin.
