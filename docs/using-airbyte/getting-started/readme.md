# Getting Started

Getting started with Airbyte takes only a few steps! This page guides you through the initial steps to get started and you'll learn how to setup your first connection on the following pages.

You have two options to run Airbyte: Use **Airbyte Cloud** (recommended) or **self-manage Airbyte** in your infrastructure.

## Sign Up for Airbyte Cloud

To use Airbyte Cloud, [sign up](https://cloud.airbyte.io/signup) with your email address, Google login, or GitHub login. Upon signing up, you'll be taken to your workspace, which lets you collaborate with team members and share resources across your team under a shared billing account.

Airbyte Cloud offers a 14-day free trial that begins after your first successful sync. For more details on our pricing model, see our [pricing page](https://www.airbyte.com/pricing).

To start setting up a data pipeline, see how to [set up a source](./add-a-source.md).


## Deploy Airbyte (Self-Managed)

When self-managing Airbyte, your data never leaves your premises. Get started immediately by deploying locally using Docker.

### Self-Managed Community (Open Source)

With Airbyte Self-Managed Community (Open Source), you can use one of the following options in your infrastructure:

- [Local Deployment](/deploying-airbyte/local-deployment.md) (recommended when trying out Airbyte)
- [On Aws](/deploying-airbyte/on-aws-ec2.md)
- [On Azure VM Cloud Shell](/deploying-airbyte/on-azure-vm-cloud-shell.md)
- [On Digital Ocean Droplet](/deploying-airbyte/on-digitalocean-droplet.md)

- [On Plural](/deploying-airbyte/on-plural.md)
- [On AWS ECS](/deploying-airbyte/on-aws-ecs.md) (Spoiler alert: it doesn't work)
