# Use Airbyte Embedded

Now that your app is running, you can create users as required. Once you create the user, the Embedded widget asks you to create connection endpoints.

Airbyte assigns the user and connections to a new workspace of the same name as the user you created. Within this workspace, administrators can see connections the end user creates.
