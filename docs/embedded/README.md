# Airbyte Embedded

[Airbyte Embedded](https://airbyte.com/ai) provides product and software teams an easy way to centrally configure and manage source connectors. This platform enables your customers to leverage new AI workloads and app models, with data being synced to modern, centralized destinations such as s3, data lakes.

AI has revolutionized how we learn and interact with the world around us. Apps like ChatGPT and Claude have shown how LLMs (large language models) can be used to translate natural language questions into intelligent insight in a matter of seconds. The result is: traditional SaaS style applications, which build user interfaces atop domain specific data such as CRM or finance, are quickly becoming obsolete.  

At the same time, as traditional UI-centric SaaS applications with their centralized data stores are being disrupted.We are seeing an emerging trend of new apps designed to aggregate data from various apps and combine them with unstructured data contained in pdfs and files, all via a universal interface or service such as MCP designed to deliver unique customer-specific context to apps provided atop general purpose LLMs. This new architecture model, based on an AI data hub, is powering an entire generation of new apps.

At the core of AI data hubs is data movement. Being able to connect, transform and move data critical for context in your AI applications, on a per customer basis, is a fundamental component to the modern AI application stack. Airbyte Embedded implements the AI data hub model, atop the trusted Airbyte platform.
