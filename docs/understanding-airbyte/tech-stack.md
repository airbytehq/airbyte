## FAQ

### _Why do we write most destination/database connectors in Java?_

JDBC makes writing reusable database connector frameworks fairly easy, saving us a lot of development time.

### _Why are most REST API connectors written in Python?_

Most contributors felt comfortable writing in Python, so we created a [Python CDK](../connector-development/cdk-python/) to accelerate this development. You can write a connector from scratch in any language as long as it follows the [Airbyte Specification](airbyte-protocol.md).

### _Why did we choose to build the server with Java?_

Simply put, the team has more experience writing production Java code.

### _Why do we use_ [_Temporal_](https://temporal.io) _for orchestration?_

Temporal solves the two major hurdles that exist in orchestrating hundreds to thousands of jobs simultaneously: scaling state management and proper queue management. Temporal solves this by offering primitives that allow serialising the jobs' current runtime memory into a DB. Since a job's entire state is stored, it's trivial to recover from failures, and it's easy to determine if a job was assigned correctly.
