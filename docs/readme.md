# Welcome to Airbyte Docs

Whether you are an Airbyte user or contributor, we have docs for you! 

### For Airbyte Cloud users

Browse the [connector catalog](integrations) to find the connector you want. In case the connector is not yet supported on Airbyte Cloud, consider using [Airbyte Open Source](#for-airbyte-open-source-users).

Next, check out the [step-by-step tutorial](cloud/getting-started-with-airbyte-cloud) to sign up for Airbyte Cloud, understand Airbyte [concepts](cloud/core-concepts.md), and run your first sync. Then learn how to [manage your Airbyte Cloud account](cloud/managing-airbyte-cloud.md).

### For Airbyte Open Source users

Browse the [connector catalog](integrations) to find the connector you want. If the connector is not yet supported on Airbyte Open Source, [build your own connector](connector-development).

Next, check out the [Airbyte Open Source QuickStart](quickstart/deploy-airbyte.md). Then learn how to [deploy](deploying-airbyte/local-deployment) and [manage](operator-guides/upgrading-airbyte) Airbyte Open Source in your cloud infrastructure. 


To get help with Airbyte deployments, check out the [Troubleshooting & FAQ](troubleshooting/README.md), chat with Support on [Discourse](https://discuss.airbyte.io/), or join us on [Community Slack](https://slack.airbyte.io/).
