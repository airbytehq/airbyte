# Review the connection state

The connection state provides additional information about incremental syncs. It includes the most recent values for the global or stream-level cursors, which can aid in debugging or determining which data will be included in the next sync. 

To review the connection state:
1. On the [Airbyte Cloud](http://cloud.airbyte.com) dashboard, click **Connections** and then click the connection you want to display.

2. Click the **Settings** tab on the Connection page.

3. Click the **Advanced** dropdown arrow. 

    **Connection State** displays.
