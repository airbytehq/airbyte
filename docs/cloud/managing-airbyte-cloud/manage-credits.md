# Manage credits

This page provides guidance on enrolling in Airbyte Cloud’s [Free Connector Program](https://airbyte.com/free-connector-program) and purchasing credits.  

## Enroll in the Free Connector Program

The Free Connector Program allows you to sync connections with [alpha](https://docs.airbyte.com/project-overview/product-release-stages#alpha) or [beta](https://docs.airbyte.com/project-overview/product-release-stages/#beta) connectors at no cost.

:::note 
    
You must be enrolled in the program to use alpha and beta connectors for free. If either the source or destination is in alpha or beta, the whole connection is free to sync. When both the source and destination of a connection become [generally available](https://docs.airbyte.com/project-overview/product-release-stages/#general-availability-ga) (GA), the connection will no longer be free. We will email you two weeks before both connectors in a connection move to GA.
    
:::

Before enrolling in the program, [set up](https://docs.airbyte.com/cloud/getting-started-with-airbyte-cloud#set-up-a-source) at least one alpha or beta connector and verify your email if you haven't already.

To enroll in the program:
1. On the [Airbyte Cloud](http://cloud.airbyte.com) dashboard, click **Credits** in the navigation bar.

2. Click **Enroll now** in the **Free Connector Program** banner.

3. Click **Enroll now**.

4. Input your credit card information and click **Save card**.

:::note 
    
Credit card information is required, even if you previously bought credits on Airbyte Cloud. This ensures uninterrupted syncs when both connectors move to GA.
    
:::

Since alpha and beta connectors are still in development, support is not provided. For additional resources, check out our [Connector Catalog](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/), [Troubleshooting & FAQ](https://docs.airbyte.com/troubleshooting/), and our [Community Slack](https://slack.airbyte.io/).

## Buy credits

Airbyte [credits](https://airbyte.com/pricing) are used to pay for Airbyte resources when you run a sync. You can purchase credits on Airbyte Cloud to keep your data flowing without interruption. 

To buy credits:

1. On the [Airbyte Cloud](http://cloud.airbyte.com) dashboard, click **Billing** in the navigation bar.

2. If you are unsure of how many credits you need, click **Talk to Sales** to find the right amount for your team.

3. Click **Buy credits**.

4. The Stripe payment page displays. If you want to change the amount of credits, click the **Qty 200** dropdown. The **Update quantity** dialog displays, and you can either type the amount or use minus (**–**) or plus (**+**) to change the quantity. Click **Update**. 

    :::note 
    
    Purchase limits:
    * Minimum: 100 credits
    * Maximum: 999 credits

    To buy more credits or a subscription plan, reach out to [Sales](https://airbyte.com/talk-to-sales).

5. Fill out the payment information. 
    
    After you enter your billing address, sales tax is calculated and added to the total.

6. Click **Pay**.
    
    Your payment is processed. The Billing page displays the available credits, total credit usage, and the credit usage per connection. 

    A receipt for your purchase is sent to your email. [Email us](mailto:ar@airbyte.io) for an invoice.

    Credits expire after one year if they are not used.
