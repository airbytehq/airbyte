## Configure Slack Notification settings

To set up Slack notifications:

If you're more of a visual learner, just head over to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjYm8F-KiFc&ab_channel=Airbyte) to learn how to do this. You can also refer to the Slack documentation on how to [create an incoming webhook for Slack](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

### Create a Slack app

1. **Create a Slack App**: Navigate to https://api.slack.com/apps/. Select `Create an App`.

2. Select `From Scratch`. Enter your App Name (e.g. Airbyte Sync Notifications) and pick your desired Slack workspace. 

3. **Set up the webhook URL.**: in the left sidebar, click on `Incoming Webhooks`.  Click the slider button in the top right to turn the feature on. Then click `Add New Webhook to Workspace`.

4. Pick the channel that you want to receive Airbyte notifications in (ideally a dedicated one), and click `Allow` to give it permissions to access the channel. You should see the bot show up in the selected channel now. You will see an active webhook right above the `Add New Webhook to Workspace` button.

5. Click `Copy.` to copy the link to your clipboard, which you will need to enter into Airbyte.

Your Webhook URL should look something like this:

### Enable the Slack notification in Airbyte

1. In the Airbyte UI, click **Settings** and navigate to **Notifications**.

2. Paste the copied webhook URL to `Webhook URL`. Using a Slack webook is recommended. On this page, you can toggle each slider decide whether you want notifications on each notification type. 

3. **Test it out.**: you can click `Test` to send a test message to the channel. Or, just run a sync now and try it out! If all goes well, you should receive a notification in your selected channel that looks like this:

You're done!

4. Click **Save changes**.

## Enable schema update notifications

To be notified of any source schema changes: 
1. Make sure you have enabled `Automatic Connection Updates` and `Connection Updates Requiring Action` notifications. If these are off, even if you turned on schema update notifications in a connection's settings, Airbyte will *NOT* send out any notifications related to these types of events.

2. In the Airbyte UI, click **Connections** and select the connection you want to receive notifications for.

3. Click the **Settings** tab on the Connection page.

4. Toggle **Schema update notifications**.
