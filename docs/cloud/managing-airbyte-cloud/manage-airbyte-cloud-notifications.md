# Manage notifications

This page provides guidance on how to manage notifications for Airbyte, allowing you to stay up-to-date on the activities in your workspace.

## Notification Event Types

| Type of Notification                              | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Failed Syncs**                                  | A sync from any of your connections fails. Note that if sync runs frequently or if there are many syncs in the workspace these types of events can be noisy               |
| **Successful Syncs**                              | A sync from any of your connections succeeds. Note that if sync runs frequently or if there are many syncs in the workspace these types of events can be noisy            |
| **Automated Connection Updates**                  | A connection is updated automatically (ex. a source schema is automatically updated)                                                                                      |
| **Connection Updates Requiring Action**           | A connection update requires you to take action (ex. a breaking schema change is detected)                                                                                |
| **Warning - Repeated Failures**                   | A connection will be disabled soon due to repeated failures. It has failed 50 times consecutively or there were only failed jobs in the past 7 days                       |
| **Sync Disabled - Repeated Failures**             | A connection was automatically disabled due to repeated failures. It will be disabled when it has failed 100 times consecutively or has been failing for 14 days in a row |
| **Warning - Upgrade Required** (Cloud only)       | A new connector version is available and requires manual upgrade                                                                                                          |
| **Sync Disabled - Upgrade Required** (Cloud only) | One or more connections were automatically disabled due to a connector upgrade deadline passing                                                                           |

### Enabling schema update notifications

To be notified of any source schema changes, make sure you have enabled `Automatic Connection Updates` and `Connection Updates Requiring Action` notifications. If these are off, even if you turned on schema update notifications in a connection's settings, Airbyte will _NOT_ send out any notifications related to these types of events.

To edit this setting, click **Connections** and select the connection you want to receive notifications for. Click the **Settings** tab on the Connection page. In the **Advanced Settings**, toggle **Schema update notifications**.

## Configure Email Notification Settings

<AppliesTo cloud />

To set up email notifications, click **Settings** and navigate to **Workspace** > **Notifications**.

Toggle which messages you'd like to receive from Airbyte. All email notifications will be sent by default to the creator of the workspace.

:::note
All email notifications except for Successful Syncs are enabled by default.
:::

### Modify the email recipient

To change the recipient, edit and save the **notification email recipient**. If you would like to send email notifications to more than one recipient, you can enter an email distribution list (ie Google Group) as the recipient.

## Configure Webhook Notification Settings
Airbyte can send notifications to any generic webhook service. This is helpful when using a downstream service to trigger transformations or other tasks in your data stack.

### Example Webhook Notification Payload
Open each section to see an example of the payload returned for the notification type. 

:::info
Airbyte passes both the `data` payload along with text blocks that are intended for Slack usage.

### Configuring Slack Notifications

The webhook notification also integrates easily with Slack. 

If you're more of a visual learner, head over to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjYm8F-KiFc&ab_channel=Airbyte) to learn how to set up a Slack app to receive notifications. You can also refer to the Slack documentation on how to [create an incoming webhook for Slack](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

### Create a Slack app

1. To set up Slack notifications, navigate to https://api.slack.com/apps/. Select `Create an App`.

![](./assets/notification-slack-create-app.png)

2. Select `From Scratch`. Enter your App Name (e.g. Airbyte Sync Notifications) and pick your desired Slack workspace.

3. **Enable Incoming Webhooks**: in the left sidebar, click on `Incoming Webhooks`. Click the slider button in the top right to turn the feature on. Then click `Add New Webhook to Workspace`.

![](./assets/notification-slack-add-webhook.png)

4. Select the channel that you want to receive Airbyte notifications in (ideally a dedicated one), and click `Allow` to give it permissions to access the channel. You should see the bot show up in the selected channel now. You will see an active webhook right above the `Add New Webhook to Workspace` button.

5. Click `Copy.` to copy the link to your clipboard, which you will need to enter into Airbyte.

Your Webhook URL should look similar to this:

```
https://hooks.slack.com/services/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PM1
```

### Enable the Slack notification in Airbyte

1. Click **Settings** and navigate to **Notifications**. On this page, you can toggle each slider decide whether you want notifications on each notification type. Paste the copied webhook URL to `Webhook URL`.

2. **Test it out**: you can click `Test` to send a test message to the channel. Or, just run a sync now and try it out! For a successful sync, you should receive a notification that looks like this:

4. Click **Save changes** to ensure you continue to receive alerts about your Airbyte syncs.
