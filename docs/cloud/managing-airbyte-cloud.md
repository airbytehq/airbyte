#### Access
| Number of workspaces | Benefits                                                                      | Considerations                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single               | All users in a workspace have access to the same data.                        | If you add a user to a workspace, you cannot limit their access to specific data within that workspace.                                     |
| Multiple             | You can create multiple workspaces to allow certain users to access data in specific workspaces only. | Have to manage user access for each workspace individually. | 
 
#### Billing
| Number of workspaces | Benefits                                                                      | Considerations                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single               | You can use the same payment method for all purchases.                        | Credits pay for the use of resources in a workspace when you run a sync. Resource usage cannot be divided and paid for separately (for example, you cannot bill different departments in your organization for the usage of some credits in one workspace).                                     |
| Multiple             |  You can use the same payment method for all purchases. | It is generally recommended to use the same payment method card for each workspace.

### Switch between multiple workspaces

## Manage credits

### Enroll in the Free Connector Program

The Free Connector Program allows you to sync connections with [alpha](https://docs.airbyte.com/project-overview/product-release-stages#alpha) or [beta](https://docs.airbyte.com/project-overview/product-release-stages/#beta) connectors at no cost.

:::note 
    
You must be enrolled in the program to use alpha and beta connectors for free. If either the source or destination is in alpha or beta, the whole connection is free to sync. When both the source and destination of a connection become [generally available](https://docs.airbyte.com/project-overview/product-release-stages/#general-availability-ga) (GA), the connection will no longer be free. We will email you two weeks before both connectors in a connection move to GA.
    
:::

Before enrolling in the program, [set up](https://docs.airbyte.com/cloud/getting-started-with-airbyte-cloud#set-up-a-source) at least one alpha or beta connector and verify your email if you haven't already.

To enroll in the program:
1. On the [Airbyte Cloud](http://cloud.airbyte.com) dashboard, click **Credits** in the navigation bar.

2. Click **Enroll now** in the **Free Connector Program** banner.

3. Click **Enroll now**.

4. Input your credit card information and click **Save card**.

:::note 
    
Credit card information is required, even if you previously bought credits on Airbyte Cloud. This ensures uninterrupted syncs when both connectors move to GA.
    
:::

Since alpha and beta connectors are still in development, support is not provided. For additional resources, check out our [Connector Catalog](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/), [Troubleshooting & FAQ](https://docs.airbyte.com/troubleshooting/), and our [Community Slack](https://slack.airbyte.io/).
