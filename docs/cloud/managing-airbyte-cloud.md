# Managing Airbyte Cloud

This page will help you manage your Airbyte Cloud workspaces and understand Airbyte Cloud limitations.

## Manage your Airbyte Cloud workspace

An Airbyte Workspace allows you to collaborate with other users and manage connections under a shared billing account.

### Single workspace vs. multiple workspaces
 
You can use one or multiple workspaces with Airbyte Cloud. 
 
#### Access
| Number of workspaces | Benefits                                                                      | Considerations                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single               | All users in a workspace have access to the same data.                        | If you add a user to a workspace, you cannot limit their access to specific data within that workspace.                                     |
| Multiple             | You can create multiple workspaces to allow certain users to access the data. | Since you have to manage user access for each workspace individually, it can get complicated if you have many users in multiple workspaces. | 
 
#### Billing
| Number of workspaces | Benefits                                                                      | Considerations                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single               | You can use the same payment method for all purchases.                        | Credits pay for the use of resources in a workspace when you run a sync. Resource usage cannot be divided and paid for separately (for example, you cannot bill different departments in your organization for the usage of some credits in one workspace).                                     |
| Multiple             | Workspaces are independent of each other, so you can use a different payment method card for each workspace (for example,  different credit cards per department in your organization). | You can use the same payment method for different workspaces, but each workspace is billed separately. Managing billing for each workspace can become complicated if you have many workspaces. |

## Manage Airbyte Cloud notifications

To set up Slack notifications:

1. On the Airbyte Cloud dashboard, click **Settings** in the navigation bar.

2. In the Workspace Settings sidebar, click **Notifications.**

3. [Create an Incoming Webhook for Slack](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

4. Navigate back to the Airbyte Cloud dashboard > Settings > Notifications and enter the Webhook URL. Click **Save changes**.

5. Toggle the **Send notifications when sync fails** and **Send notifications when sync succeeds** buttons as required.

## Understand Airbyte Cloud limits

Understanding the following limitations will help you better manage Airbyte Cloud:

* Max number of workspaces per user: 100
* Max number of sources in a workspace: 100
* Max number of destinations in a workspace: 100
* Max number of connection in a workspace: 100
* Max number of streams that can be returned by a source in a discover call: 1K
* Max number of streams that can be configured to sync in a single connection: 1K
* Size of a single record: 100MB
* Shortest sync schedule: Every 60 min
* Schedule accuracy: +/- 30 min

## View the sync summary
The sync summary displays information about the data moved during a sync.
 
To view the sync summary:
1. On the [Airbyte Cloud](http://cloud.airbyte.io/) dashboard, click **Connections** in the navigation bar.   

    The Connections page displays.

2. Click a connection in the list to view its sync history.

    Sync History displays the sync status or [reset](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/reset/) status (Succeeded, Partial Success, Failed, Cancelled, or Running) and the [sync summary](#sync-summary).  

    :::note 
    
    Airbyte will try to sync your data three times. After a third failure, it will stop attempting to sync.
    
    :::
    
3. To view the full sync log, click the sync summary dropdown.
 
### Sync summary
| Data                            | Description                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| x GB (also measured in KB, MB) | Amount of data moved during the sync. If basic normalization is on, the amount of data would not change since normalization occurs in the destination.  |
| x emitted records              | Number of records read from the source during the sync.                                                                                                 |
| x committed records            | Number of records the destination confirmed it received.                                                                                                |
| xh xm xs                   | Total time (hours, minutes, seconds) for the sync and basic normalization, if enabled, to complete.                                                     | 

:::note

In a successful sync, the number of emitted records and committed records should be the same.

|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Replication Frequency     | How often the data syncs                                                                                                                  |
| [Destination Namespace](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/namespaces/)     | Where the replicated data is written                                                                                                      |
| Destination Stream Prefix | Helps you identify streams from different connectors |

:::note 
    
These parameters apply to all streams in the connection.

2. Enter a cron expression and choose a time zone to create a sync schedule.

:::note

* Only one sync per connection can run at a time. 
* If cron schedules a sync to run before the last one finishes, the scheduled sync will start after the last sync completes.
* Cloud does not allow schedules that sync more than once per hour.
