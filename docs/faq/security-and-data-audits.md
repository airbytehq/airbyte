# Security & Data Audits

### **How secure is Airbyte?**

Airbyte is an open-source self-hosted solution, so let’s say it is as safe as your data infrastructure. ****

### **Is Airbyte GDPR compliant?**

Airbyte is a self-hosted solution, so it doesn’t bring any security or privacy risk to your infrastructure. We do intend to add data quality and privacy compliance features in the future, in order to give you more visibility on that topic. 

### **How does Airbyte charge?**

Well, we don’t, as the connectors are all under the MIT license. If you are curious about the business model we have in mind, please check our [company handbook](https://docs.airbyte.io/company-handbook/company-handbook/business-model).
