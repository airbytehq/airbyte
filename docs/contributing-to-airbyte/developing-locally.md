# Developing Locally

The following technologies are required to build Airbyte locally.

1. `Java 14`
2. `Node 14`
3. `Python 3.7`
4. `Docker`
5. `Postgresql`
6. `Jq`
7. `CMake`
8. `Rust`

Manually switching between different language versions can get hairy. We recommend using a version manager such as `pyenv` or `jenv`.
{% endhint %}

To start contributing:

1. Start by [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository
2. Clone the fork on your workstation:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:{YOUR_USERNAME}/airbyte.git
   cd airbyte
   ```

3. You're ready to start!

## Build with `gradle`

To compile the code and run unit tests:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

This will build all the code and run all the unit tests.

`./gradle build` creates all the necessary artifacts \(Webapp, Jars and Docker images\) so that you can run Airbyte locally.

{% hint style="info" %}
On Mac, if you run into an error while compiling openssl \(this happens when running pip install\), you may need to explicitly add these flags to your bash profile so that the C compiler can find the appropriate libraries.

```text
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
```
{% endhint %}

## Run in `dev` mode with `docker-compose`

```bash
./gradlew build
docker-compose --env-file .env.dev -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

The build will take a few minutes. Once it completes, Airbyte compiled at current git revision will be running in `dev` mode in your environment.

In `dev` mode, all data will be persisted in `/tmp/dev_root`.

## Run acceptance tests

To run acceptance \(end-to-end\) tests, you must have the Airbyte running locally.

```bash
./gradlew build
VERSION=dev docker-compose up
./gradlew :airbyte-tests:acceptanceTests
```

## Develop on individual applications

The easiest way to develop on one of Airbyte's modules is to spin up the whole Airbyte system on your workstation, and shutdown the module you want to work on.

### Develop on `airbyte-webapp`

* Spin up Airbyte locally so the UI can make requests against the local API.
* Stop the `webapp`.

```bash
docker-compose stop webapp
```

* Start up the react app.

```bash
cd airbyte-webapp
npm install
npm start
```

* Happy Hacking!

### Develop on `airbyte-server` \(APIs\)

* Spin up Airbyte locally.
* Stop the `server`.

```bash
docker-compose stop server
```

* Run the `server` with the command line. It will build and start a `server` with the current state of the code. You can also start the `server` from your IDE if you need to use a debugger.

```bash
./gradlew :airbyte-server:run
```

* Make sure everything is working by testing out a call to the API.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json"\
 -X POST localhost:8001/api/v1/workspaces/get\
 -d '{ "workspaceId": "5ae6b09b-fdec-41af-aaf7-7d94cfc33ef6" }'
```

* Happy Hacking!

_Note: We namespace most API calls with a workspace id. For now there is only ever one workspace that is hardcoded to the id used in this example. If you ever need a workspace id, just use this one._

### Develop on `airbyte-scheduler`

* Spin up Airbyte locally.
* Stop the `scheduler`.

```bash
docker-compose stop scheduler
```

* Run the `scheduler` with the command line. It will build and start a `scheduler` with the current state of the code. You can also start the `scheduler`from your IDE if you need to use a debugger.

```bash
./gradlew :airbyte-scheduler:run
```

* Happy Hacking!

### Connector Specification Caching

The Configuration API caches connector specifications. This is done to avoid needing to run docker everytime one is needed in the UI. Without this caching, the UI crawls. If you update the specification of a connector and you need to clear this cache so the API / UI pick up the change. You have two options: 1. Go to the Admin page in the UI and update the version of the connector. Updating to the same version will for the cache to clear for that connector. 1. Restart the server

```bash
        docker-compose --env-file .env.dev -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml down -v
        docker-compose --env-file .env.dev -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

### Resetting the Airbyte developer environment

Sometimes you'll want to reset the data in your local environment. One common case for this is if you are updating an connector's entry in the database \(`airbyte-config/init/src/main/resources/config`\), often the easiest thing to do, is wipe the local database and start it from scratch. To reset your data back to a clean install of Airbyte, follow these steps:

* Delete the datastore volumes in docker

  ```bash
    docker-compose --env-file .env.dev -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml down -v
  ```

* Remove the data on disk

  ```bash
    rm -rf /tmp/dev_root
    rm -rf /tmp/airbyte_local
  ```

* Rebuild the project

  ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   docker-compose --env-file .env.dev -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -V
  ```
