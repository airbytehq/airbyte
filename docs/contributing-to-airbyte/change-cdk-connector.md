Before jumping into the code please first:
1. Verify if an existing [connector](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea%2Fconnectors+-label%3Aneeds-triage+label%3Acommunity) 
2. If you don't find an existing issue...
   1. [Report a Bug Connector](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fbug%2Carea%2Fconnectors%2Cneeds-triage&projects=&template=1-issue-connector.yaml)
   2. [Request a New Connector Feature](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fenhancement%2Cneeds-triage&projects=&template=6-feature-request.yaml)

This will enable our team to make sure your contribution does not overlap with existing works and will comply with the design orientation we are currently heading the product toward. If you do not receive an update on the issue from our team, please ping us on [Slack](https://slack.airbyte.io)!

## Breaking Changes to Connectors

Often times, changes to connectors can be made without impacting the user experience.Â  However, there are some changes that will require users to take action before they can continue to sync data.Â  These changes are considered **Breaking Changes** and require a

1. A **Major Version** increaseÂ 
2. An Airbyte Engineer to follow theÂ  [Connector Breaking Change Release Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1VYQggHbL_PN0dDDu7rCyzBLGRtX-R3cpwXaY8QxEgzw/edit) before merging.

### Types of Breaking Change(s):
A breaking change is any change that will require users to take action before they can continue to sync data. The following are examples of breaking changes:

- **Spec Change** - The configuration required by users of this connector have been changed and syncs will fail until users reconfigure or re-authenticate.Â  This change is not possible via a Config MigrationÂ 
- **Schema Change** - The type of a property previously present within a record has changed
- **Stream or Property Removal** - Data that was previously being synced is no longer going to be synced.
- **Destination Format / Normalization Change** - The way the destination writes the final data or how normalization cleans that data is changing in a way that requires a full-refresh.**
- **State Changes** - The format of the sourceâ€™s state has changed, and the full dataset will need to be re-synced
