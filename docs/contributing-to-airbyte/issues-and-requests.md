# Issues and Feature Requests

#### Report a Bug

Bug reports help us make Airbyte better for everyone. We provide a preconfigured template for reporting bugs to make it very clear what information we need. To avoid duplicate reports, check if the bug was [already reported](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atype%2Fbug) before raising a new one.

#### Request new Features or a Connector

Requesting new features [or connectors](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/discussions/categories/new-connector-request) is an essential way to contribute. Your input helps us understand your needs and priorities, enabling us to enhance the functionality and versatility of Airbyte. [Starting a Github Discussion](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/discussions) is the best way to do it.

#### Reporting Security Issues

Please do not create a public GitHub issue. If you've found a security issue, please email us directly at [security@airbyte.io](mailto:security@airbyte.io) instead of raising an issue.
