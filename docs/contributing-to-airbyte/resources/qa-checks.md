This document is listing all the static-analysis checks that are performed on the Airbyte connectors.
These checks are running in our CI/CD pipeline and are used to ensure a connector is following the best practices and is respecting the Airbyte standards.
Meeting these standards means that the connector will be able to be safely integrated into the Airbyte platform and released to registries (DockerHub, Pypi etc.).
You can consider these checks as a set of guidelines to follow when developing a connector.
They are by no mean replacing the need for a manual review of the connector codebase and the implementation of good test suites.
