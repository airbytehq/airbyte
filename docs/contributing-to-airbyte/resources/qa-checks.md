# Airbyte connectors QA checks

This document is listing all the static-analysis checks that are performed on the Airbyte connectors.
These checks are running in our CI/CD pipeline and are used to ensure a connector is following the best practices and is respecting the Airbyte standards.
Meeting these standards means that the connector will be able to be safely integrated into the Airbyte platform and released to registries (DockerHub, Pypi etc.).
You can consider these checks as a set of guidelines to follow when developing a connector.
They are by no mean replacing the need for a manual review of the connector codebase and the implementation of good test suites.

## 📄 Documentation

### Breaking changes must be accompanied by a migration guide

_Applies to the following connector types: source, destination_
_Applies to the following connector languages: java, low-code, python, manifest-only_
_Applies to connector with any support level_
_Applies to connector with any internal support level_
_Applies to connector with any Airbyte usage level_

When a breaking change is introduced, we check that a migration guide is available. It should be stored under `./docs/integrations/<connector-type>s/<connector-name>-migrations.md`.
This document should contain a section for each breaking change, in order of the version descending. It must explain users which action to take to migrate to the new version.

### Connectors must have user facing documentation

_Applies to the following connector types: source, destination_
_Applies to the following connector languages: java, low-code, python, manifest-only_
_Applies to connector with any support level_
_Applies to connector with any internal support level_
_Applies to connector with any Airbyte usage level_

The user facing connector documentation should be stored under `./docs/integrations/<connector-type>s/<connector-name>.md`.

### Links used in connector documentation are valid

_Applies to the following connector types: source_
_Applies to the following connector languages: python, low-code_
_Applies to connector with any support level_
_Applies to connector with 300 internal support level_
_Applies to connector with any Airbyte usage level_

The user facing connector documentation should update invalid links in connector documentation. For links that are used as example and return 404 status code, use `example: ` before link to skip it.

### Connectors documentation headers structure, naming and order follow our guidelines
