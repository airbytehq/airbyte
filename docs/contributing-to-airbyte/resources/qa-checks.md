# Airbyte connectors QA checks

This document is listing all the static-analysis checks that are performed on the Airbyte connectors.
These checks are running in our CI/CD pipeline and are used to ensure a connector is following the best practices and is respecting the Airbyte standards.
Meeting these standards means that the connector will be able to be safely integrated into the Airbyte platform and released to registries (DockerHub, Pypi etc.).
You can consider these checks as a set of guidelines to follow when developing a connector.
They are by no mean replacing the need for a manual review of the connector codebase and the implementation of good test suites.


## üìÑ Documentation

### Breaking changes must be accompanied by a migration guide
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: java, low-code, python*

When a breaking change is introduced, we check that a migration guide is available. It should be stored under  `./docs/integrations/<connector-type>s/<connector-name>-migrations.md`.
This document should contain a section for each breaking change, in order of the version descending. It must explain users which action to take to migrate to the new version.
### Connectors must have user facing documentation
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: java, low-code, python*

The user facing connector documentation should be stored under `./docs/integrations/<connector-type>s/<connector-name>.md`.
### Connectors must have a changelog entry for each version
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: java, low-code, python*

Each new version of a connector must have a changelog entry defined in the user facing documentation in `./docs/integrations/<connector-type>s/<connector-name>.md`.

## üìù Metadata

### Connectors must have valid metadata.yaml file
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: java, low-code, python*

Connectors must have a `metadata.yaml` file at the root of their directory. This file is used to build our connector registry. Its structure must follow our metadata schema. Field values are also validated. This is to ensure that all connectors have the required metadata fields and that the metadata is valid. More details in this [documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/connector-metadata-file).
### Connector must have a language tag in metadata
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: java, low-code, python*

Connectors must have a language tag in their metadata. It must be set in the `tags` field in metadata.yaml. The values can be `language:python` or `language:java`. This checks infers the correct language tag based on the presence of certain files in the connector directory.
### Python connectors must have a CDK tag in metadata
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: python, low-code*

Python connectors must have a CDK tag in their metadata. It must be set in the `tags` field in metadata.yaml. The values can be `cdk:low-code`, `cdk:python`, or `cdk:file`.

## üì¶ Packaging

### Connectors must use Poetry for dependency management
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: python, low-code*

Connectors must use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. This is to ensure that all connectors use a dependency management tool which locks dependencies and ensures reproducible installs.
### Connectors must be licensed under MIT or Elv2
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: java, low-code, python*

Connectors must be licensed under the MIT or Elv2 license. This is to ensure that all connectors are licensed under a permissive license. More details in our [License FAQ](https://docs.airbyte.com/developer-guides/licenses/license-faq).
### Connector license in metadata.yaml and pyproject.toml file must match
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: python, low-code*

Connectors license in metadata.yaml and pyproject.toml file must match. This is to ensure that all connectors are consistently licensed.
### Connector version must follow Semantic Versioning
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: java, low-code, python*

Connector version must follow the Semantic Versioning scheme. This is to ensure that all connectors follow a consistent versioning scheme. Refer to our [Semantic Versioning for Connectors](https://docs.airbyte.com/contributing-to-airbyte/#semantic-versioning-for-connectors) for more details.
### Connector version in metadata.yaml and pyproject.toml file must match
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: python, low-code*

Connector version in metadata.yaml and pyproject.toml file must match. This is to ensure that connector release is consistent.
### Python connectors must have PyPi publishing enabled
*Applies to the following connector types: source*
*Applies to the following connector languages: python, low-code*

Python connectors must have [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) publishing enabled in their `metadata.yaml` file. This is declared by setting `remoteRegistries.pypi.enabled` to `true` in metadata.yaml. This is to ensure that all connectors can be published to PyPi and can be used in `airbyte-lib`.

## üíº Assets

### Connectors must have an icon
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: java, low-code, python*

Each connector must have an icon available in at the root of the connector code directory. It must be an SVG file named `icon.svg` and must be a square.

## üîí Security

### Connectors must use HTTPS only
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: java, low-code, python*

Connectors must use HTTPS only when making requests to external services.
### Python connectors must not use a Dockerfile and must declare their base image in metadata.yaml file
*Applies to the following connector types: source, destination*
*Applies to the following connector languages: python, low-code*

Connectors must use our Python connector base image (`docker.io/airbyte/python-connector-base`), declared through the `connectorBuildOptions.baseImage` in their `metadata.yaml`.
This is to ensure that all connectors use a base image which is maintained and has security updates.
