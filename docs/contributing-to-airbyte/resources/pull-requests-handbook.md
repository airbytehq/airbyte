# Pull Request Handbook

### Pull Request Title Convention

When creating a pull request follow the naming conventions depending on the change being made.
In general the pull request title starts with an emoji with the connector you're doing the changes, eg (‚ú® Source E-Commerce: add new stream `Users`).
Airbyte uses this pattern to automatically assign team reviews and build the product release notes.

| Pull Request Type | Emoji | Examples |
| ----------------- | ----- | ---------|
| New Connector (Source or Destination)  | üéâ | üéâ New Destination: Database                           |
| Add a feature to an existing connector | ‚ú® | ‚ú® Source E-Commerce: add new stream `Users`           |
| Fix a bug                              | üêõ | üêõ Source E-Commerce: fix start date parameter in spec |
| Documentation (updates or new entries) | üìù | üìù Fix Database connector changelog                    |
| It's a breaking change                 | üö® | üö®üö®üêõ Source Kafka: fix a complex bug                  |

For more information about [breaking changes](#breaking-changes-to-connectors). A maintainer will help and instruct about possible breaking changes.

Any refactors, cleanups, etc.. that are not visible improvements to the user should not have emojis.

If you're code change is doing more than one change type at once we strongly recommend to break into multiple pull requests. It helps us to review and merge your contribution.

## Descriptions

**Context**: Provide enough information \(or a link to enough information\) in the description so team members with no context can understand what the issue or PR is trying to accomplish. This usually means you should include two things:

1. Some background information motivating the problem
2. A description of the problem itself
3. Good places to start reading and file changes that can be skipped

   Some examples:

_insufficient context_: `Create an OpenAPI to JSON schema generator`. Unclear what the value or problem being solved here is.

_good context_:

```text
When creating or updating connectors, we spend a lot of time manually transcribing JSON Schema files based on OpenAPI docs. This is ncessary because OpenAPI and JSON schema are very similar but not perfectly compatible. This process is automatable. Therefore we should create a program which converts from OpenAPI to JSONSchema format.
```

## Semantic Versioning for Connectors

Changes to connector behavior should always be accompanied by a version bump and a changelog entry. We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to version changes to connectors. Since connectors are a bit different from APIs, we have our own take on semantic versioning, focusing on maintaining the best user experience of using a connector.

- Major: a version in which a change is made which requires manual intervention (update to config or configured catalog) for an existing connection to continue to succeed, or one in which data that was previously being synced will no longer be synced
- Minor: a version that introduces user-facing functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- Patch: a version that introduces backwards compatible bug fixes or performance improvements

### Examples

Here are some examples of code changes and their respective version changes:
