# Offboarding

Transparency is one of our pillar values. And even though offboarding can be a sensitive time, we feel it’s important to shed some light on this process. 

A note here: this process only applies to employees and long-term contractors who we consider as team members. It doesn’t apply to short-term contractors.

## Communicating Departures

Sometimes, we won’t be able to provide context around why a person is leaving when they do. There might be personal reasons. However, we will be as transparent as possible. 

When employees leave us voluntarily, we will ask them if they’d like to share their next adventure with the team.

In the case of involuntary departure, if asked by any team member, we will share the reasons for the departure within the limit of the local regulation. We learn through our failures. An involuntary departure is above all our own failure, and it’s therefore a learning experience for the company. We understand that this might be uncomfortable for the person in question, so this is something that we only do after the departure of the ex-employee. 

## Voluntary Departure

Depending on the country the team member lives in, they may or may not be entitled to a notice period. Our philosophy is that 30 days is enough for knowledge transfer, and hopefully, to find someone to hire and enable a handover. 

In the US, notice periods are a lot shorter. We will respect the team member’s choice if they only want to give 2-weeks’ notice. 

If you are currently a team member and are thinking of resigning from Airbyte, we strongly encourage you to talk about it with your manager or the co-founders. We value candor and feedback. So this is a great opportunity for us to learn how we can do better, and possibly keep you in the team. A resignation shouldn’t come as a surprise \(which means you shouldn’t feel stressed on the day you resign, as all should have been talked about before\). 

## Involuntary Departure

In this case, we require the team member to leave without a notice period. If you’ve stayed more than 6 months in the company, we will provide a 1-month severance pay. This policy applies to both US and non-US team members, if local regulations allow it. 

Involuntary departures are not necessarily performance based; they can also occur because the role is no longer required to fulfill company needs.

If the involuntary departure is based on performance, it shouldn’t come as a surprise.

## The Process for Offboarding

We will hold an exit interview \(either virtual or in person\) to discuss important details with the individual who is leaving. The following points will be discussed: 

1. Final pay
2. Vested share options 
3. Company property
4. Business expenses
5. Personal email to the company, to say goodbye. You have been part of our team, and we only have great intentions for you and your next adventure!

## Final Pay

An employee’s final pay will be determined based on their length of service and reasons for leaving.

* Voluntary offboarding: You will be paid through your last day of work. We will assume you would have the rights to 25 vacation days per year and will pro-rate any "unused" vacation pay.
* Involuntary offboarding due to business changes or performance issues: If you have more than 6 months of service with Airbyte, you will be given 1 months’ severance pay. 
* Voluntary offboarding: If your departure occurs during your first 6 months of employment and is performance related, we will give you 1 week’s notice.
* Involuntary offboarding for legal or ethical reasons \(e.g., breach of contract, gross misconduct\): You may be terminated immediately with no notice and no final pay.
* Departing team members, voluntary or involuntary, may be asked to sign a release of claims to enable receipt of payments beyond their last day at work. 

Please note: In cases where local laws govern the final pay of discharged employees, we will pay whichever of the amounts is greater: the final pay delineated above or the legally required minimum. 

## Vested Share Options

If you hold share options, we will confirm the number vested and your preferred process for exercising them. We offer a team-friendly 10-year post-departure exercise window; most departing team members are considered “good leavers” unless  termination occurred in light of misconduct or negligence.

## Company Property

Any and all company property must be returned upon your departure from the company. Airbyte will cover shipping costs as necessary.

## Business Expenses

Upon your departure from Airbyte, we will pay any unpaid expenses you incurred that are in line with our policy. Any unpaid expenses you incurred that are not covered by our policy will be your responsibility. 

## Personal Email to the Company

Those employees exiting the company in good standing will be given the opportunity to send a “goodbye email” to the company, including future contact information if you so desire. 

## Offboarding Checklist
