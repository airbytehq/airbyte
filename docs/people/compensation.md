# Compensation

We strive for a **fair effective compensation strategy**. This implies several things: 

1. As mentioned in our [Diversity & Inclusion](../company/diversity-inclusion-and-belonging.md) efforts, we have a **transparent compensation philosophy**. We believe your compensation should not be impacted by your ability to negotiate, but by your experience, abilities and the impact you have on Airbyte. We hope this will also help reduce wage gaps.
2. All employees should have some equity in the company. If you contribute to its success, you should also benefit from it. 
3. Compensation will be adjusted based on your location. If you relocate to a more expensive area, your compensation should also be readjusted immediately. If you move to a location where cost of life and salaries are lower, your compensation will also be adjusted after some time. 

Adjusting based on location enables the company to  

## Salary Calculator

We’ve tried to keep compensation simple with a calculator, based on the location and the level. The compensation will evolve based on performances and role evolution. 

We will publish the calculator very soon.

## Equity through Stock Options

As part of your compensation, you will receive share options in the company with a standard 1-year cliff, and a total vesting period of 4 years with a monthly vesting schedule. Broadly, the amount of options will depend on your role and experience. 

Here are the terms of the options: 

* Vesting begins immediately upon your start date \(no probation period required\).
* US employees will be able to do an early exercise of their stock options. Unfortunately, this is something we cannot offer to non-US team members.
* For non-US team members or US ones that didn’t opt for the early exercise, you have up to 3 months after leaving Airbyte to exercise your options.

It may take some time for your options to be approved - it involves company 409a valuation and a board meeting - but your vesting begins from the moment you join Airbyte, so you don’t have to worry about when it will take effect. 

## Relocating

​If you plan to relocate permanently, your salary will be adjusted \(up or down\) to reflect living expenses in your new location.

If this adjustment represents an increase in pay, we will need to approve the change in advance; we cannot always guarantee that our budget will allow the pay increase.

## Nomading

​If you intend to spend more than 8 months from your home base, we will adjust your pay according to your location at the end of the 8 months.

If you have many destinations planned over a period of more than 8 months, we will factor in the location of the various places you plan to stay, averaged by the amount of time spent.

If you are uncertain about where you'll be traveling and you will be traveling for over 8 months, then your pay will remain the same throughout the 8 months. At the end of the 8 months, we will manually adjust your next pay amount based on the average of the 8 months you travelled. This will take place every 8 months until you have completed your travels. 

If this adjustment to your income would require us to reclaim more than your entire pay amount \(for example, if you moved from one of the most expensive areas in the world to one of the  least expensive areas\), we would work with you on how quickly the amount is reclaimed.
