# Onboarding

Doing a great job at welcoming a new member is of the utmost importance for a remote company. 

The onboarding process may look a little different depending on where you are based and what type of contract you are on. We will let you choose between joining as an employee or contractor \(with equivalent terms and benefits as an employee\). Depending on the country and local taxes, it might be more or less financially interesting to be a contractor than an employee \(possibly through an employer of record\). 

## After You Accepted Our Offer

We’re pumped and honored to have you on board!

Here are a few tasks we will do:

* Every team member sends a welcome email
* Invite on our public Slack
* Ask for hardware \(Laptop, headphone…\) & get it before the first day
* Ask for books and get them before the first day \(maybe we have one that we recommend?\)

If you join as a US employee, we will order a corporate card so you can purchase the equipment yourself. 

If you don’t join as a US employee, we will share with you a virtual card that will allow you to  order for yourself. 

It’s extremely important that you send us the receipts, as explained in the [expense policy](expense-policy.md).  


## The Week Before You Join

There is some administrative work to do to make sure you’re all set up. 

If you’re a US employee, we will add you on Rippling, so it can gather all the necessary documents for you to be ready for your first day. If you are located in a state, we are not registered into, we will need to register Airbyte, Inc. there, using Middesk.

For a non-US employee, we will send you the contract through Deel, which will manage your pay, so you get paid before the end of the month every month. Deel will ask you for all your compliance documents. 

We will also:

* Send you an email 3 days before your first day
* Introduce your buddy
* Invite to checkout the project \(if an engineer\)
* Point to the first ticket \(if an engineer\)
* Ask for GitHub handle \(if an engineer\)

* For engineers: Access to the handbook shared drive

There should also be a 1-2-hour onboarding project with your buddy. For instance, for engineering roles, it could be:

* Integrations 

## In Your First Week

Here are a few tasks to do

* First meeting with Michel and John to discuss the culture and values of the company
* First 1:1 meeting with direct manager \(if any\)
* Complete first project
* Meet every team members \(Buddy can help schedule\)
* Project where they can ship code in the first week.

For the next few weeks, the new team member is encouraged to:

* Book virtual coffees with all other team members to make their acquaintance within the next few weeks
* Book any extra session with any team members to discuss any topic!

## Airbyte Buddy

We know that starting a new job can be both exciting and overwhelming. To make things a little easier for you during your first few weeks, we have implemented a buddy system. Your buddy will help with any questions you may have and will help you get acquainted with everyone and everything during your first few weeks at Airbyte. 

Everyone at Airbyte is happy to help you, of course, but we’ve found it useful for new employees to have one specific go-to person.  We will try to pair people in similar time zones, whenever possible, to make it easier to communicate with each other in real time. Ideally, you and your buddy will catch up at least once a week your first few weeks—not only about work, but other topics of shared interest that will help develop a stronger rapport. Don’t hesitate to schedule daily syncs with your buddy.
