# Benefits

Here is the list of benefits we provide:

* **Fully remote flexible work environment**  - we don’t look at when you log in, log out or how much time you work. We look at your output and we trust you; it’s the only way remote can actually work. 
* \*\*\*\*[**Unlimited vacation policy**](time-off.md) ****- we need you at your best at all times. Our expected minimum time off lets you schedule your work around your life.
* \*\*\*\*[**Co-working space stipend**](expense-policy.md#work-space) - we provide each employee with $200/month to use towards alternative home-office solutions such as a co-working space.
* \*\*\*\*[**Parental leave**](time-off.md#parental-leave) **\(for both parents\)** - so you have time to adjust to the new life \(and work\) schedule introduced by your new bundle of joy.
* **Open book policy** - we will pay for books you purchase for your professional and career development. 
* **Continuous learning/training policy** - we sponsor you for the conferences and training programs you feel would add to your development in the company. 
* **Health insurance** for those whose countries do not provide it for free. In the US, health insurance is provided through Savvy, which means you receive a stipend from Airbyte to choose the insurance you want. 
* **Mental Health Counseling** provided via [Spill](https://www.spill.chat/).
* **401k** for US employees. 
* **Sponsored visas** for employees in need of them.
