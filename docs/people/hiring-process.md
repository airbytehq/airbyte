# Hiring Process

Here’s what is most important to us in our hiring process:

* It needs to be efficient, and could be done within a week.
* It needs to remove any unconscious bias we might have.

Here’s what the process looks like for a **non-engineering role**:

* One first call with one of our founders or team. It will focus on two key areas:
  * Ensuring you will be a great cultural fit
  * Aptitude for the role
* If you succeed with the above, we may do a **written interview**. Here are[ several reasons](https://www.safegraph.com/blog/why-safegraph-does-written-interviews-and-why-your-company-should-do-them-too) why we're big fans of this kind of interview. The main argument is that it removes a lot of the bias people might have during live interviews. Plus, we mostly work asynchronously nowadays. 
* If the written interview is a success, we might set you up with one or two additional calls to test how you actually think and work, and also so you meet the rest of the team.
* Once all of this is done, we will discuss the process internally and get back to you quickly \(velocity is everything here!\). So about two or three calls and one written interview, and that's it!

Now, here’s how the process goes for **an engineering role**: 

* One first call with one of our founders or team. It will focus on two key areas:
  * Ensuring you will be a great cultural fit
  * Aptitude for the role
* Two to three “onsite” interviews with some members of our engineering team. In all transparency, the more interviews you have, the more you should consider that there are things we still need to validate, as we’re not entirely sure.
* A last call with the second co-founder. Again, in all transparency, this interview’s goal is to see if you would add to our culture, and to convince you to join!
