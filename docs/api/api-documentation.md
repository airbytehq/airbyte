# API documentation

Our Configuration API is still in alpha and might change. You wonâ€™t lose any functionality, but you may need to update your code to catch up to any backwards incompatible changes in the API.

**Check it out** [**here**](https://airbyte-public-api-docs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rapidoc-api-docs.html)**.** It is still rudimentary, and we will improve in the next couple of weeks.

Don't hesitate to ask us on [Slack](https://slack.airbyte.io), if you have any questions about it.
