# MCP Servers

Airbyte provides multiple MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to enable AI-assisted data integration workflows for different use cases. 

- The PyAirbyte MCP is a local MCP server for managing Airbyte connectors through AI assistants.
- The Connector Builder MCP (coming soon) is an AI-assisted connector development.

In addition to these MCP servers, you can also use [AI connectors](../connectors) with the Connector MCP Server.
