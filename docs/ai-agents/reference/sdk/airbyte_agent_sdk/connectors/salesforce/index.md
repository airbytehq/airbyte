    For hosted mode execution, provide client credentials with either:
    - `connector_id`: Direct connector/source ID (skips lookup)

        # Hosted mode with connector_id (no lookup needed)
        connector = GongConnector(
            auth_config=AirbyteAuthConfig(
                airbyte_client_id="client_abc123",

    ### Instance variables

    `connector_id: str | None`
    :   Get the connector/source ID (only available in hosted mode).

            SalesforceCheckResult with status ("healthy" or "unhealthy") and optional error message
        
        Example:
            result = await connector.check()
            if result.status == "healthy":
                print("Connection verified!")
            else:
                print(f"Check failed: \{result.error\}")

    `close(self)`
    :   Close the connector and release resources.

    `entity_schema(self, entity: str) ‑> dict[str, typing.Any] | None`
    :   Get the JSON schema for an entity.
        
        Args:

    :   Execute an entity operation with full type safety.
        
        This is the recommended interface for blessed connectors as it:
        - Uses the same signature as non-blessed connectors
        - Provides full IDE autocomplete for entity/action/params
        - Makes migration from generic to blessed connectors seamless
        
        Args:

                action="get",
                params=\{"id": "cus_123"\}
            )

    `list_entities(self) ‑> list[dict[str, typing.Any]]`
    :   Get structured data about available entities, actions, and parameters.
        
        Returns a list of entity descriptions with:

        - description: Entity description from the first endpoint
        - available_actions: List of actions (e.g., ["list", "get", "create"])
        - parameters: Dict mapping action -> list of parameter dicts
        
        Example:
            entities = connector.list_entities()
            for entity in entities:
                print(f"\{entity['entity_name']\}: \{entity['available_actions']\}")
