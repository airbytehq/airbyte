# Calling tools

Tools are external capabilities an AI agent can invoke. They allow agents to perceive, decide, and act beyond conversatonal UIs.

## What tools do and why you need them

Large language models, by default, lack real-time knowledge, are stateless, and cannot act and verify facts. This places severe limits on their capabilities. Tools solve this problem by expanding the capabilities of an LLM. Tools are callable functions, services, and interfaces that an AI agent can use to:

- Retrive informaton it doesn't have
- Perform computations or transformations
- Interact with external systems
- Trigger side-effects, like sending emails, updating databases, and triggering workflows
