# Airbyte API

The Airbyte API allows you to build a fully integrated Airbyte Embedded Experience.

You'll go through the following steps in a typical flow:
1. [Configuring connections](./connection-templates.md): Connections define where your users data will land.
2. [Configuring source templates](./source-templates.md): Templates define which connectors are available for your end users
3. [Configuring sources](./configuring-sources.md): Collect your users credentials so their data is synced to your data warehouse.

The complete API reference can be found at https://api.airbyte.ai/api/v1/redoc
