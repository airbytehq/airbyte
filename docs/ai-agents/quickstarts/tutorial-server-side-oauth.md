# Implement your own OAuth flow

If you provide an environment where your users can create connectors, they need to supply their credentials so their agents can access their data. Airbyte provides a standard [Embedded widget](../embedded/widget) for this purpose. However, you might prefer to create a fully customized OAuth flow with your own branding and UX. In this case, implement your own OAuth flow.

## Part 1 (Optional): Configure OAuth overrides

## Part 2: Initiate the OAuth flow

## Part 3: Create a source

## Part 4: Execute actions
