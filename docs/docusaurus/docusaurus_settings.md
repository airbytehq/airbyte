# Docusaurus Settings

Docusaurus is the tool that generates the website that hosts docs in cloud and OSS.
Here are some quick relevant guides using docusaurus at Airbyte.

### I want to change the sidebar
- **OSS**: sidebar is generated in a [JSON blob here](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/docusaurus/sidebars.js)
- **OSS**: Here is a guide to the [JSON blob structure](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/items)
- **Cloud**: sidebar is autogenerated
  - folders will become dropdown items
  - if there is a `README.md` in the folder
    - it will be the default view
    - the first `# heading` will be the folder title
  - if there is not a `README.md` in the folder name of folder will be the drop down name

### But how do I change the links on top?
- go to one of these config files
  - [OSS file location](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/docusaurus/docusaurus.config.js)
  - [Cloud file location](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-cloud/blob/master/docusaurus/docusaurus.config.js#L64)
- Copy an existing JSON object like this but change the values a bit so people don't think you copied my homework
```js
{
    href: 'https://theuselessweb.com',
    position: 'left',
    label: 'A collection of useless websites',
},
```

- test locally [following this guide](locally_testing_docusaurus.md)


### Updating docusaurus

For security and an occasional cool features you may want to update docusaurus.  From time to time docusaurus will suggest you do just that.
It is a reasonable decision to copy the update command docusaurus suggests.  It should look something like this:
```bash
yarn upgrade @docusaurus/core@latest @docusaurus/plugin-google-gtag@latest @docusaurus/preset-classic@latest
```
Keep in mind this won't update dependencies.  The upside is that the dependencies probably won't break.  
The downside is that they probably also contain known security vulnerabilities.
