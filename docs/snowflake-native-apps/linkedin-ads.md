# LinkedIn Ads Connector

The LinkedIn Ads Connector by Airbyte is a Snowflake Native Application that allows you to extract data from your LinkedIn Ads account and load records into a Snowflake database of your choice.

:::info
The Snowflake Native Apps platform is new and rapidly evolving. The LinkedIn Ads Connector by Airbyte is in _private preview_ and is subject to further development that may affect setup and configuration of the application. Please note that, at this time, only a [full table refresh](../understanding-airbyte/connections/full-refresh-overwrite.md) without deduplication is supported.  
:::

# Getting started

## Prerequisites
A LinkedIn Ads account with permission to access data from accounts you want to sync.

## Installing the App

:::warning
Do not refresh the Apps page while the application is being installed. This may cause installation to fail.
:::

1. Log into your Snowflake account.
2. On the left sidebar, click `Marketplace`.
3. Search for `Linkedin Ads Connector` by Airbyte or navigate to https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTYZ9BCRSJ/airbyte-linkedin-ads-connector-by-airbyte
4. Click `Request`. This will send a request that we will manually service as soon as we can.
5. On the left sidebar, click `Apps`.
6. Under the `Recently Shared with You` section, you should see the `Linkedin Ads Connector by Airbyte`. Click `Get`.
7. Expand `Options`.
    1. You can rename the application or leave the default. This is how you will reference the application from a worksheet.
    2. Specify the warehouse that the application will be installed to.
8. Click `Get`.
9. Wait for the application to install. Once complete, the pop-up window should automatically close.

You should now see the LinkedIn Ads Connector by Airbyte application under `Installed Apps`. You may need to refresh the page.

## LinkedIn Ads Account
In order for the LinkedIn Ads Connector by Airbyte to query LinkedIn, you will need an account with the right permissions. Please follow the [LinkedIn Ads authentication guide](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/linkedin-ads/#set-up-linkedin-ads-authentication-airbyte-open-source) for further information.

## Snowflake Native App Authorizations

:::note
By default the app will be installed using the name `AIRBYTE_LINKEDIN_ADS`, but if you renamed the app during installation, you will have to use that name as a reference.
:::

1. Create the database where the app will access the authorization. This database can be different from the database where the sync will output records.
```
CREATE DATABASE <database>;
USE <database>;
```

2. The native app will validate the output database and create it if it does not exist. In order to do that, the app needs access to the database:
```
GRANT CREATE DATABASE ON ACCOUNT TO APPLICATION <app_name>;
```

3. You will need to allow outgoing network traffic based on the domain of the source. In the case of LinkedIn Ads, simply run:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE NETWORK RULE linkedin_apis_network_rule
  MODE = EGRESS
  TYPE = HOST_PORT
  VALUE_LIST = ('api.linkedin.com', 'www.linkedin.com', 'linkedin.com');
```

:::note  
As of 2023-09-13, the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-external-access-integration) mentions that direct external access is a preview feature and that it is `available to all accounts on AWS` which might restrict the number of users able to use the connector.
:::

4. Once you have external access configured, you need define your authorization/authentication. Provide the credentials to the app as such:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE SECRET integration_linkedin_ads_oauth
  TYPE = GENERIC_STRING
  SECRET_STRING = '{
    "auth_method": "oAuth2.0",
    "client_id": <client_id>,
    "client_secret": <client_secret>,
    "refresh_token": <refresh_token>
  }';
```
... where `client_id`, `client_secret` and `refresh_token` are strings. For more information, see the [LinkedIn Ads authentication guide](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/linkedin-ads/#set-up-linkedin-ads-authentication-airbyte-open-source).

5. Once the network rule and the secret are defined in Snowflake, you need to make them available to the app by using an external access integration.
```
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION integration_linkedin_ads
  ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES = (linkedin_apis_network_rule)
  ALLOWED_AUTHENTICATION_SECRETS = (integration_linkedin_ads_oauth)
  ENABLED = true;
```

6. Grant permission for the app to access the integration.
```
GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION integration_linkedin_ads TO APPLICATION AIRBYTE_LINKEDIN_ADS;
```

7. Grant permissions for the app to access the database that houses the secret and read the secret.
```
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE <your_database> TO APPLICATION AIRBYTE_LINKEDIN_ADS;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <your_schema> TO APPLICATION AIRBYTE_LINKEDIN_ADS;
GRANT READ ON SECRET integration_linkedin_ads_oauth TO APPLICATION AIRBYTE_LINKEDIN_ADS;
```

8. Grant permissions for the app to create a warehouse on which to execute sync tasks, and to execute tasks.
```
GRANT CREATE WAREHOUSE ON ACCOUNT TO APPLICATION AIRBYTE_LINKEDIN_ADS;
GRANT EXECUTE TASK ON ACCOUNT TO APPLICATION AIRBYTE_LINKEDIN_ADS;
```


## Configure a connection
Once this is all set up, you can now configure a connection. To do so, use the Streamlit app by going in the `Apps` section and selecting `AIRBYTE_LINKEDIN_ADS`. You will have to accept the Anaconda terms in order to use Streamlit. 

![](./linkedin-ads-ui.gif)

Once you have access to the app, select `New Connection` and fill the following fields:

--- 

`Secret` 

The name of the secret prefixed by which database and schema. Based on the previous steps: `<database>.<your_schema>.integration_linkedin_ads_oauth`.

---

`External Access Integration`

Name of the Snowflake integration where the secret and network rules are configured. Based on the previous steps: `integration_linkedin_ads`.

--- 

`start_date`

UTC date in the format 2020-09-17. Any data before this date will not be replicated. 

---

`account_ids`

Leave empty, if you want to pull the data from all associated accounts. To specify individual account IDs to pull data from, separate them by a space. See the [LinkedIn Ads docs](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a424270/find-linkedin-ads-account-details) for more info.

---

`Output Database`

The database where the records will be saved. Snowflake's database [naming convention](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/identifiers-syntax) applies here.

---

`Output Schema`

The table where the schema will be saved. Snowflake's table [naming convention](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/identifiers-syntax) applies here. 

--- 

`Connection name`

How the connection will be referred in the Streamlit app.

--- 

`Replication Frequency`

How often records are fetched.

---

## Enabling Logging and Event Sharing for an Application
Sharing the logging and telemetry data of your installed application helps us improve the application and can allow us to better triage problems that your run into. To configure your application for logging and telemetry data please refer to the documentation for [Enabling Logging and Event Sharing](event-sharing.md).

## Run a sync
Once a connection is configured, go in `Connections List` and click on `Sync Now` for the connection you want to sync. Once the sync is complete, you should be able to validate that the records have been stored in `<your_database>.<your_schema>`

### Supported Streams
As of now, all supported streams perform a full refresh. Incremental syncs are not yet supported. Here are the list of supported streams:
* Accounts
* Account Users
* Ad Analytics by Campaign
* Ad Analytics by Creative
* Campaigns
* Campaign Groups
* Creatives
