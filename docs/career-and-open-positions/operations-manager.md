# Operations manager

## **About Airbyte**

[Airbyte](http://airbyte.io/) is the upcoming open-source standard for data integration. We enable data teams to replicate data from applications, APIs, and databases to data warehouses, lakes, and other destinations. We believe only an open-source approach can solve the problem of data integration, as it enables us to cover the long tail of integrations while enabling teams to adapt prebuilt connectors to their needs.

Although the alpha version was only launched 5 months ago, 750 companies have already replicated data with Airbyte, which recently raised a $5.2M seed round with Accel and YC \(in addition to high-profile investors as the co-founder of Segment, Liveramp or Cloudera execs\). 

Airbyte is remote friendly, with most of the team still based in the Silicon Valley. We’re fully open as a company. Our[ company handbook](https://docs.airbyte.io/company-handbook),[ culture & values](https://docs.airbyte.io/company-handbook/culture-and-values),[ strategy](https://docs.airbyte.io/company-handbook/strategy) and[ roadmap](https://docs.airbyte.io/roadmap) are open to all.

We believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales engine with cold calls.
