# Senior Software Engineer

## **About Airbyte**

[Airbyte](https://airbyte.io/) is the upcoming [open-source](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte) standard for EL\(T\). We enable data teams to replicate data from applications, APIs, and databases to data warehouses, lakes, and other destinations. We believe open-source is the only approach that can solve the problem of data integration. It allows us to cover the long tail of integrations while enabling teams to adapt pre-built connectors to their needs.

Airbyte is remote friendly, with most of the team based in the Bay Area. We’re fully open as a company. Our [company handbook](https://docs.airbyte.io/company-handbook), [culture & values](https://docs.airbyte.io/company-handbook/culture-and-values), [strategy](https://docs.airbyte.io/company-handbook/strategy) and [roadmap](https://docs.airbyte.io/roadmap) are open to all.

We're a seed-stage company backed by some of the world's [top investors](https://docs.airbyte.io/career-and-open-positions#our-investors) and believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales engine with cold calls.

## **Responsibilities**

We are looking for an engineer who is passionate about data, open source and scale. You will be working with other engineers to design and build the future standard of data integration. 

As an early member of our engineering team, you will play a significant role in shaping the future of Airbyte: product, team culture, process, and everything in between. You’ll take ownership of mission-critical work across all levels of the stack: building and scaling our core platform including execution, configuration, scheduling, integration with data ecosystem \(DBT, Airflow, Spark, K8s...\), monitoring, APIs, deployment, build system and more. You will also scale our connector infrastructure to provide an amazing Developer Experience \(DX\) to our contributors and new members of the team. 

Today, our stack is composed of several technologies: Java, Python, Docker, Typescript/React, K8s...

As part of a high-growth startup, you will also have the opportunity to collaborate closely with company leaders, users, partners, and non-engineering parts of the business. Every Airbyte engineer plays a critical role in shaping the future of our product, team, and culture. 

If you love taking the lead on ambitious projects, having lots of latitude, and working in a high velocity team, this may be just the role for you.

## **Requirements**

* 3+ years of experience
* Self-directed and work with minimal supervision
* Proficiency in at least one programming language: we don’t mind which one
* Passion for data and solving a fundamental industry problem
* Excited about working on Open Source and in the open
* You share [our values](https://docs.airbyte.io/company-handbook/culture-and-values)

## **Location**

Wherever you want!
