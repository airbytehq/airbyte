# Technical Recruiter

## **About Airbyte**

[Airbyte](http://airbyte.io) is the upcoming open-source standard for EL\(T\). We enable data teams to replicate data from applications, APIs, and databases to data warehouses, lakes, and other destinations. We believe only an open-source approach can solve the problem of data integration, as it enables us to cover the long tail of integrations while enabling teams to adapt prebuilt connectors to their needs.

Airbyte is remote friendly, with most of the team still based in the Silicon Valley. We’re fully open as a company. Our **[company handbook](https://handbook.airbyte.io)**, **[culture & values](https://handbook.airbyte.io/company/culture-and-values)**, **[strategy](https://handbook.airbyte.io/strategy/strategy)** and **[roadmap](../project-overview/roadmap.md)** are open to all.

We raised a total of $31.2M by some of the world's [top investors](./#our-investors) (Benchmark, Accel, YCombinator, co-founders or CEOs of Segment, Elastic, MongoDB, Cloudera, etc.) and believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales engine with cold calls.
