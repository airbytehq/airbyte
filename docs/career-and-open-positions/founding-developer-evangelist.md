# Founding Developer Evangelist

## **About Airbyte**

[Airbyte](http://airbyte.io) is the upcoming open-source standard for EL\(T\). We enable data teams to replicate data from applications, APIs, and databases to data warehouses, lakes, and other destinations. We believe only an open-source approach can solve the problem of data integration, as it enables us to cover the long tail of integrations while enabling teams to adapt prebuilt connectors to their needs. 

Airbyte is remote friendly, with most of the team still based in the Silicon Valley. We’re fully open as a company. Our [company handbook](../company-handbook/), [culture & values](../company-handbook/culture-and-values.md), [strategy](../company-handbook/strategy.md) and [roadmap](../roadmap.md) are open to all.

We're backed by some of the world's [top investors](./#our-investors) and believe in product-led growth
