# Founding Developer Evangelist

## **About Airbyte**

[Airbyte](http://airbyte.io) is the upcoming open-source standard for EL(T). We enable data teams to replicate data from applications, APIs, and databases to data warehouses, lakes, and other destinations. We believe only an open-source approach can solve the problem of data integration, as it enables us to cover the long tail of integrations while enabling teams to adapt prebuilt connectors to their needs. 

Airbyte is remote friendly, with most of the team still based in the Silicon Valley. We’re fully open as a company. Our **[company handbook](https://handbook.airbyte.io)**, **[culture & values](https://handbook.airbyte.io/company/culture-and-values)**, **[strategy](https://handbook.airbyte.io/strategy/strategy)** and **[roadmap](../project-overview/roadmap.md)** are open to all.

We raised a total of $31.2M by some of the world's [top investors](./#our-investors) (Benchmark, Accel, YCombinator, co-founders or CEOs of Segment, Elastic, MongoDB, Cloudera, etc.) and believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales engine with cold calls.

## **Description**

As our first Developer Evangelist, you will have two focuses:

1. **Building a content hub focused on data engineering** (and not Airbyte per se), featuring a podcast that brings thought leaders and community members into the conversation. This will be supplemented by a rich catalog of written content focused on increasing Airbyte’s share of voice in the data integration space.
2. **Launching a meetup program around data engineering**, leveraging the content hub’s brand

The goal of the developer evangelism program is to make Airbyte’s content hub the best place to get thoughtful content on data engineering. As the first member of our developer evangelism team, you will work closely with the founders and our growing community team. 

## **Responsibilities**

* Own the content hub’s content production and guest list 
* Create data engineering thought leadership posts
* Produce a podcast with guests/outside contributors
* Collaborate with DevRel to produce high impact content and reach mass developers
* Lead the conversation around the latest technology advancements and best practices in the developer community 
* Lead the efforts in creating an international meetup program around the content hub
* Be a force in the community!

## **Requirements**

## **Location**

Remote but compatible with US timezones.

## **We provide**

* **Flexible work environment as fully remote** - we don’t look at when you log in, log out or how much time you work. We trust you, it’s the only way remote can actually work. 
* **[Unlimited vacation policy](https://handbook.airbyte.io/people/time-off)** with mandatory minimum time off - so you can fit work around your life.
* **[Co-working space stipend](https://handbook.airbyte.io/people/expense-policy#work-space)** - we provide everyone with $200/month to use on a coworking space of their choice, if any.
* **[Parental leave](https://handbook.airbyte.io/people/time-off#parental-leave)** \(for both parents, after one year spent with the company\) - so those raising families can do so while still working for us.
* **Open book policy** - we reimburse books that employees want to purchase for their professional and career development. 
* **Continuous learning / training policy** - we sponsor the conferences and training programs you feel would add to your development in the company. 
* **Health insurance** for those from countries that do not provide this freely. Through Savvy in the US, which means you can choose the insurance you want and will receive a stipend from the company. 
* **401k** for the US employees. 
* **Sponsored visas** for those who need them
* We'll give you a corporate card for expenses. Our philosophy is Freedom & Responsibiility. We trust you, just do what's best for the company.
