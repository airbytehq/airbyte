# Founding Developer Advocate

## **About Airbyte**

[Airbyte](http://airbyte.io) is the upcoming open-source standard for EL\(T\). We enable data teams to replicate data from applications, APIs, and databases to data warehouses, lakes, and other destinations. We believe only an open-source approach can solve the problem of data integration, as it enables us to cover the long tail of integrations while enabling teams to adapt prebuilt connectors to their needs.

Airbyte is remote friendly, with most of the team still based in the Silicon Valley. Weâ€™re fully open as a company. Our [company handbook](../company-handbook/), [culture & values](../company-handbook/culture-and-values.md), [strategy](../company-handbook/strategy.md) and [roadmap](../roadmap.md) are open to all.

We're backed by some of the world's [top investors](./#our-investors) and believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales engine with cold calls.

## **Description**

As our Founding Developer Advocate, you will own three priorities:

1. **Ensure Airbyte provides a world class contributor experience**. This can be anything from building tutorials and documentation or advocating for users to the product & engineering team to brainstorming and executing on new ideas. 
2. **Foster & develop the Airbyte community of users and contributors**. We want our community to have such an amazing experience with Airbyte that they become our evangelists outside the company. 
3. **Generate awareness about Airbyte**. We want Airbyte to be top of mind for anyone looking for an ELT solution, OSS or otherwise. 

This is a function-founding role: you'll have a large ownership over building out Airbyte's developer advocacy program. You'll collaborate closely with the founders, the core team, and the community.
