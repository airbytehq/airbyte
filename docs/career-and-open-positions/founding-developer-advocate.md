# Founding Developer Advocate

## **About Airbyte**

[Airbyte](http://airbyte.io) is the upcoming open-source standard for EL\(T\). We enable data teams to replicate data from applications, APIs, and databases to data warehouses, lakes, and other destinations. We believe only an open-source approach can solve the problem of data integration, as it enables us to cover the long tail of integrations while enabling teams to adapt prebuilt connectors to their needs.

Airbyte is remote friendly, with most of the team still based in the Silicon Valley. We’re fully open as a company. Our [company handbook](../company-handbook/), [culture & values](../company-handbook/culture-and-values.md), [strategy](../company-handbook/strategy.md) and [roadmap](../roadmap.md) are open to all.

We're backed by some of the world's [top investors](./#our-investors) and believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales engine with cold calls.

## **Description**

As our Founding Developer Advocate, you will own three priorities:

1. **Ensure Airbyte provides a world class contributor experience**. This can be anything from building tutorials and documentation or advocating for users to the product & engineering team to brainstorming and executing on new ideas. 
2. **Foster & develop the Airbyte community of users and contributors**. We want our community to have such an amazing experience with Airbyte that they become our evangelists outside the company. 
3. **Generate awareness about Airbyte**. We want Airbyte to be top of mind for anyone looking for an ELT solution, OSS or otherwise. 

This is a function-founding role: you'll have a large ownership over building out Airbyte's developer advocacy program. You'll collaborate closely with the founders, the core team, and the community. You'll take on all sorts of tasks from writing sample code or setting up a swag program to shaping the vision for developer advocacy at Airbyte.

* Help us provide the most frictionless experience to our audience, by constantly improving our documentation and tutorials
* Organize or participate in \(online or offline\) events to give Airbyte a voice
* Lead the conversation around the latest technology advancements and best practices in the developer community 
* Channel information back to product and engineering about your learnings from the community
* Be a force in the community!

## **Requirements**

* At least 3 years of experience giving talks and developing demos, webinars, videos, and other technical content
* Meaningful social presence with engaged followers
* Self-directed and work with minimal supervision.

* You share [our values](../company-handbook/culture-and-values.md)

## **Location**

## **We provide**

* **Flexible work environment as fully remote** - we don’t look at when you log in, log out or how much time you work. We trust you, it’s the only way remote can actually work.

* **Coworking space stipend** - we provide everyone with $200/month to use on a coworking space of their choice, if any.
* **Very generous parental leave** (for both parents, after one year spent with the company) - so those raising families can do so while still working for us.
* **Open book policy** - we reimburse books that employees want to purchase for their professional and career development. 
* **Continuous learning / training policy** - we sponsor the conferences and training programs you feel would add to your development in the company. 
* **Health insurance** for those from countries that do not provide this freely. Through Savvy in the US, which means you can choose the insurance you want and will receive a stipend from the company. 
* **401k** for the US employees. 
* **Sponsored visas** for those who need them
* We'll give you a corporate card for expenses. Our philosophy is Freedom & Responsibiility. We trust you, just do what's best for the company.
