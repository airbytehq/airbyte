# Connector Development Kit (Javascript)

The [Faros AI TypeScript/JavaScript CDK](https://github.com/faros-ai/airbyte-connectors/tree/main/faros-airbyte-cdk) allows you to build Airbyte connectors quickly similarly to how our [Python CDK](cdk-python/) does. This CDK currently offers support for creating Airbyte source connectors for:

* HTTP APIs

## Resources

[This document](https://github.com/faros-ai/airbyte-connectors/blob/main/sources/README.md) is the main guide for developing an Airbyte source with the Faros CDK.

An example of a source built with the Faros AI CDK can be found [here](https://github.com/faros-ai/airbyte-connectors/tree/main/sources/example-source). It's recommended that you follow along with the example source while building for the first time.
