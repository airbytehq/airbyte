# Step 5: Incremental Reads

We now have a working implementation of a connector reading the latest exchange rates for a given currency.
In this section, we'll update the source to read historical data instead of only reading the latest exchange rates.

According to the API documentation, we can read the exchange rate for a specific date by querying the "/{date}" endpoint instead of "/latest".

We'll now add a `start_date` property to the connector.

First we'll update the spec `source_exchange_rates_tutorial/spec.yaml`

```
documentationUrl: https://docs.airbyte.io/integrations/sources/exchangeratesapi
connectionSpecification:
  $schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#
  title: exchangeratesapi.io Source Spec
  type: object
  required:
    - start_date
    - access_key
    - base
  additionalProperties: true
  properties:
    start_date:
      type: string
      description: Start getting data from that date.
      pattern: ^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}$
      examples:
        - YYYY-MM-DD
    access_key:
      type: string
      description: >-
        Your API Access Key. See <a
        href="https://exchangeratesapi.io/documentation/">here</a>. The key is
        case sensitive.
      airbyte_secret: true
    base:
      type: string
      description: >-
        ISO reference currency. See <a
        href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html">here</a>.
      examples:
        - EUR
        - USD
```

Then we'll set the `start_date` to last week our connection config in `secrets/config.json`.
The following `echo` command will update your config with a start date set at 7 days prior to today.

```
echo "{\"access_key\": \"<your_access_key>\", \"start_date\": \"$(date -v -7d '+%Y-%m-%d')\", \"base\": \"USD\"}"  > secrets/config.json
```

And we'll update the `path` in the connector definition to point to `/{{ config.start_date }}`.
Note that we are setting a default value because the `check` operation does not know the `start_date`. We'll default to hitting `/latest`:

```
retriever:
  requester:
      path:
        type: "InterpolatedString"
        string: "{{ config.start_date }}"
        default: "/latest"
```

You can test the connector by executing the `read` operation:

```python main.py read --config secrets/config.json --catalog integration_tests/configured_catalog.json```

By reading the output record, you should see that we read historical data instead of the latest exchange rate.
For example:
> "historical": true, "base": "USD", "date": "2022-07-18"

The connector will now always read data for the start date, which is not exactly what we want.
Instead, we would like to iterate over all the dates between the start_date and today and read data for each day.

We can do this by adding a `DatetimeStreamSlicer` to the connector definition, and update the `path` to point to the stream_slice's `start_date`:
More details on the stream slicers can be found [here](./link-to-stream-slicers.md) <FIXME: need to fix links>

Let's first define a stream slicer at the top level of the connector definition:

```
stream_slicer:
  type: "DatetimeStreamSlicer"
  start_datetime:
    datetime: "{{ config.start_date }}"
    datetime_format: "%Y-%m-%d"
  end_datetime:
    datetime: "{{ now_local() }}"
    datetime_format: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"
  step: "1d"
  datetime_format: "%Y-%m-%d"
```

and refer to it in the stream's retriever. Note that we're also setting the `cursor_field` in the stream's `options` because it is used both by the `Stream` and the `StreamSlicer`:

```
rates_stream:
  type: DeclarativeStream
  options:
    name: "rates"
    cursor_field: "date
  primary_key: "date"
  schema_loader:
    ref: "*ref(schema_loader)"
  retriever:
    ref: "*ref(retriever)"
    stream_slicer:
      ref: "*ref(stream_slicer)"
```

And we'll update the path to point to the `stream_slice`'s start_date

```
requester:
  ref: "*ref(requester)"
  path:
    type: "InterpolatedString"
    string: "{{ stream_slice.start_date }}"
    default: "/latest"
```

The full connector definition should now look like `./source_exchange_rates_tutorial/exchange_rates_tutorial.yaml`:

```
schema_loader:
  type: JsonSchema
  file_path: "./source_exchange_rates_tutorial/schemas/{{ options.name }}.json"
selector:
  type: RecordSelector
  extractor:
    type: JelloExtractor
    transform: "[_]"
requester:
  type: HttpRequester
  name: "{{ options['name'] }}"
  url_base: "https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/v1/"
  http_method: "GET"
  request_options_provider:
    request_parameters:
      access_key: "{{ config.access_key }}"
      base: "{{ config.base }}"
stream_slicer:
  type: "DatetimeStreamSlicer"
  start_datetime:
    datetime: "{{ config.start_date }}"
    datetime_format: "%Y-%m-%d"
  end_datetime:
    datetime: "{{ now_local() }}"
    datetime_format: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"
  step: "1d"
  datetime_format: "%Y-%m-%d"
retriever:
  type: SimpleRetriever
  name: "{{ options['name'] }}"
  primary_key: "{{ options['primary_key'] }}"
  record_selector:
    $ref: "*ref(selector)"
  paginator:
    type: NoPagination
  stream_slicer:
    $ref: "*ref(stream_slicer)"
rates_stream:
  type: DeclarativeStream
  $options:
    name: "rates"
    cursor_field: "date"
  primary_key: "date"
  schema_loader:
    $ref: "*ref(schema_loader)"
  retriever:
    $ref: "*ref(retriever)"
    requester:
      $ref: "*ref(requester)"
      path:
        type: "InterpolatedString"
        string: "{{ stream_slice.start_date }}"
        default: "/latest"
streams:
  - "*ref(rates_stream)"
check:
  type: CheckStream
  stream_names: ["rates"]
```

Running the `read` operation will now read all data for all days between start_date and now:

```
python main.py read --config secrets/config.json --catalog integration_tests/configured_catalog.json
```

The operation should now output more than one record:

```
{"type": "LOG", "log": {"level": "INFO", "message": "Read 8 records from rates stream"}}
```

## Supporting incremental syncs

Instead of always reading data for all dates, we would like the connector to only read data for dates we haven't read yet.
This can be achieved by updating the catalog to run in incremental mode (`integration_tests/configured_catalog.json`):

```
{
  "streams": [
    {
      "stream": {
        "name": "rates",
        "json_schema": {},
        "supported_sync_modes": [
          "full_refresh",
          "incremental"
        ]
      },
      "sync_mode": "incremental",
      "destination_sync_mode": "overwrite"
    }
  ]
}
```

In addition to records, the `read` operation now also outputs state messages:

```
{"type": "STATE", "state": {"data": {"rates": {"date": "2022-07-15"}}}}
```

Where the date ("2022-07-15") should be replaced by today's date.

We can simulate incremental syncs by creating a state file containing the last state produced by the `read` operation.
`source-exchange-rates-tutorial/integration_tests/sample_state.json`:

```
{
  "rates": {
    "date": "2022-07-15"
  }
}
```

Running the `read` operation will now only read data for dates later than the given state:

```
python main.py read --config secrets/config.json --catalog integration_tests/configured_catalog.json --state integration_tests/sample_state.json
```

There shouldn't be any data read if the state is today's date:

```
{"type": "LOG", "log": {"level": "INFO", "message": "Setting state of rates stream to {'date': '2022-07-15'}"}}
{"type": "LOG", "log": {"level": "INFO", "message": "Read 0 records from rates stream"}}
```

## Next steps:

Next, we'll run the [Source Acceptance Tests suite to ensure the connector invariants are respected](6-testing.md).
