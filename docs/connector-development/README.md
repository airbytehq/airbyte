# Connector Development

If you'd like to build a connector that doesn't yet exist in Airbyte's catalog, in most cases you should use [Connector Builder](./connector-builder-ui/overview.md)!
Builder works for most API source connectors as long as you can read the data with HTTP requests (REST, GraphQL) and get results in JSON or JSONL formats, CSV and XML support to come soon.

In rare cases when you need something more complex, you can use the Low-Code CDK directly. Other options and SDKs are described below.

:::note

Before building a new connector, review [Airbyte's data protocol specification](../understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol.md). As you begin, you should also familiarize yourself with our guide to [Best Practices for Connector Development](./best-practices.md).
If you need support along the way, visit the [Slack channel](https://airbytehq.slack.com/archives/C027KKE4BCZ) we have dedicated to helping users with connector development where you can search previous discussions or ask a question of your own.

### Process overview

1. **Pick the technology and build**. The first step in creating a new connector is to choose the tools you’ll use to build it. For _most_ cases, you should start in Connector Builder. To understand which approach you should take, review the [compatibility guide](./connector-builder-ui/connector-builder-compatibility.md).
2. **Publish as a custom connector**.After building and testing your connector, you’ll need to publish it. This makes it available in your workspace. At that point, you can use the connector you’ve built to move some data!
3. **Contribute back to Airbyte**. If you want to contribute what you’ve built to the Airbyte Cloud and OSS connector catalog, follow the steps provided in the [contribution guide for submitting new connectors](../contributing-to-airbyte/submit-new-connector.md).

| [Connector Builder](./connector-builder-ui/overview.md)                             | We recommend Connector Builder for developing a connector for an API source. If you’re using Airbyte Cloud, no local developer environment is required to create a new connection with the Connector Builder because you configure it directly in the Airbyte web UI. This tool guides you through creating and testing a connection. Refer to our [tutorial](./connector-builder-ui/tutorial.mdx) on the Connector Builder to guide you through the basics. |
| [Low Code Connector Development Kit (CDK)](./config-based/low-code-cdk-overview.md) | This framework lets you build source connectors for HTTP API sources. The Low-code CDK is a declarative framework that allows you to describe the connector using a [YAML schema](./schema-reference) without writing Python code. It’s flexible enough to include [custom Python components](./config-based/advanced-topics.md#custom-components) in conjunction with this method if necessary.                                                             |
| [Python Connector Development Kit (CDK)](./cdk-python/basic-concepts.md)            | While this method provides the most flexibility to developers, it also requires the most code and maintenance. This library provides classes that work out-of-the-box for most scenarios you’ll encounter along with the generators to make the connector scaffolds for you. We maintain an [in-depth guide](./tutorials/custom-python-connector/0-getting-started.md) to building a connector using the Python CDK.                                         |
| [Java CDK](./tutorials/building-a-java-destination.md)                              | If you're bulding a source or a destination against a traditional database (not an HTTP API, not a vector database), you should use the Java CDK instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
