# Connector Development Kit \(C# .NET\)

The [Airbyte Dotnet CDK](https://github.com/mrhamburg/airbyte.cdk.dotnet) is a framework for rapidly developing production-grade Airbyte connectors. The CDK currently offers helpers specific for creating Airbyte source connectors for:

* HTTP APIs \(REST APIs, GraphQL, etc..\)
* Generic Dotnet sources \(anything not covered by the above\)

The CDK provides an improved developer experience by providing basic implementation structure and abstracting away low-level glue boilerplate.

[This document](https://github.com/mrhamburg/airbyte.cdk.dotnet/blob/main/README.md) is the main guide for developing an Airbyte source with the Dotnet CDK.
