# Substreams

Substreams are streams that depend on the records on another stream

We might for instance want to read all the commits for a given repository (parent stream).

## Substream slicer

Substreams are implemented by defining their stream slicer as a`SubstreamSlicer`.

For each stream, the slicer needs to know

- what the parent stream is
- what is the key of the records in the parent stream
- what is the field defining the stream slice representing the parent record
- how to specify that information on an outgoing HTTP request

Assuming the commits for a given repository can be read by specifying the repository as a request_parameter, this could be defined as

```yaml
stream_slicer:
  type: "SubstreamSlicer"
  parent_streams_configs:
    - stream: "*ref(repositories_stream)"
      parent_key: "id"
      stream_slice_field: "repository"
      request_option:
        field_name: "repository"
        inject_into: "request_parameter"
```

REST APIs often nest sub-resources in the URL path.
If the URL to fetch commits was "/repositories/:id/commits", then the `Requester`'s path would need to refer to the stream slice's value and no `request_option` would be set:

```yaml
retriever:
  <...>
  requester:
    <...>
    path: "/respositories/{{ stream_slice.repository }}/commits
  stream_slicer:
    type: "SubstreamSlicer"
    parent_streams_configs:
      - stream: "*ref(repositories_stream)"
        parent_key: "id"
        stream_slice_field: "repository"
```
