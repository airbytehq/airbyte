# Retrieving Records Spread Across Partitions

In some cases, the data you are replicating is spread across multiple partitions. You can specify a set of parameters to be iterated over and used while requesting all of your data. On each iteration, using the current element being iterated upon, the connector will perform a cycle of requesting data from your source.

`PartitionRouter`s gives you the ability to specify either a static or dynamic set of elements that will be iterated over one at a time. This in turn is used to route requests to a partition of your data according to the elements iterated over.

The most common use case for the `PartitionRouter` component is the retrieval of data from an API endpoint that requires extra request inputs to indicate which partition of data to fetch.

Schema:

```yaml
  partition_router:
    default: []
    anyOf:
      - "$ref": "#/definitions/CustomPartitionRouter"
      - "$ref": "#/definitions/ListPartitionRouter"
      - "$ref": "#/definitions/SubstreamPartitionRouter"
      - type: array
        items:
          anyOf:
            - "$ref": "#/definitions/CustomPartitionRouter"
            - "$ref": "#/definitions/ListPartitionRouter"
            - "$ref": "#/definitions/SubstreamPartitionRouter"
```

Notice that you can specify one or more `PartitionRouter`s on a Retriever. When multiple are defined, the result will be Cartesian product of all partitions and a request cycle will be performed for each permutation.

## ListPartitionRouter

`ListPartitionRouter` iterates over values from a given list. It is defined by

- The partition values, which are the valid values for the cursor field
- The cursor field on a record
- request_option: optional request option to set on outgoing request parameters

Schema:

```yaml
  ListPartitionRouter:
    description: Partition router that is used to retrieve records that have been partitioned according to a list of values
    type: object
    required:
      - type
      - cursor_field
      - slice_values
    properties:
      type:
        type: string
        enum: [ListPartitionRouter]
      cursor_field:
        type: string
      partition_values:
        anyOf:
          - type: string
          - type: array
            items:
              type: string
      request_option:
        "$ref": "#/definitions/RequestOption"
      $parameters:
        type: object
        additionalProperties: true
```

As an example, this partition router will iterate over the 2 repositories ("airbyte" and "airbyte-secret") and will set a request_parameter on outgoing HTTP requests.

```yaml
partition_router:
  type: ListPartitionRouter
  values:
    - "airbyte"
    - "airbyte-secret"
  cursor_field: "repository"
  request_option:
    type: RequestOption
    field_name: "repository"
    inject_into: "request_parameter"
```

## SubstreamPartitionRouter

Substreams are streams that depend on the records of another stream

We might for instance want to read all the commits for a given repository (parent stream).

Substreams are implemented by defining their partition router as a `SubstreamPartitionRouter`.

`SubstreamPartitionRouter` is used to route requests to fetch data that has been partitioned according to a parent stream's records . We might for instance want to read all the commits for a given repository (parent resource).

- what the parent stream is
- what is the key of the records in the parent stream
- what is the attribute on the parent record that is being used to partition the substream data
- how to specify that attribute on an outgoing HTTP request to retrieve that set of records

Schema:

```yaml
  SubstreamPartitionRouter:
    description: Partition router that is used to retrieve records that have been partitioned according to records from the specified parent streams
    type: object
    required:
      - type
      - parent_stream_configs
    properties:
      type:
        type: string
        enum: [SubstreamPartitionRouter]
      parent_stream_configs:
        type: array
        items:
          "$ref": "#/definitions/ParentStreamConfig"
      $parameters:
        type: object
        additionalProperties: true
```

Example:

```yaml
partition_router:
  type: SubstreamPartitionRouter
  parent_streams_configs:
    - stream: "#/repositories_stream"
      parent_key: "id"
      partition_field: "repository"
      request_option:
        type: RequestOption
        field_name: "repository"
        inject_into: "request_parameter"
```

REST APIs often nest sub-resources in the URL path.
If the URL to fetch commits was "/repositories/:id/commits", then the `Requester`'s path would need to refer to the stream slice's value and no `request_option` would be set:

Example:

```yaml
retriever:
  <...>
  requester:
    <...>
    path: "/respositories/{{ stream_slice.repository }}/commits"
  partition_router:
    type: SubstreamPartitionRouter
    parent_streams_configs:
      - stream: "#/repositories_stream"
        parent_key: "id"
        partition_field: "repository"
```

## Nested streams

Nested streams, subresources, or streams that depend on other streams can be implemented using a [`SubstreamPartitionRouter`](#SubstreamPartitionRouter)
