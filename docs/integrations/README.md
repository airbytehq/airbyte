# Connectors

A connector is a tool to pull data from a source or push data to a destination.

Source connectors connect to the APIs, file, databases, or data warehouses from which you want to pull data. Destination connectors are the data warehouses, data lakes, databases, or analytics tools to which you want to push data.

Browse Airbyte's catalog below to see which connectors are available, read their documentation, or review the code and GitHub issues for that connector. Most connectors are available in both Cloud and Self-Managed versions of Airbyte, but some are only available in Self-Managed.

## Contribute to Airbyte's connectors

Don't see the connector you need? Need a connector to do something it doesn't currently do? Airbyte's connectors are open source. You can [build entirely new connectors](../platform/connector-development/) or contribute enhancements, bug fixes, and features to existing connectors. We encourage contributors to [add your changes](../platform/contributing-to-airbyte/) to Airbyte's public connector catalog, but you always have the option to publish them privately in your own workspaces.
