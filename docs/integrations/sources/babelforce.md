# Babelforce

## Overview

The Babelforce source supports _Full Refresh_ as well as _Incremental_ syncs. 

_Full Refresh_ sync means every time a sync is run, Airbyte will copy all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication into the destination in a new table.
_Incremental_ syn means only changed resources are copied from Babelformce. For the first run, it will be a Full Refresh sync.

### Output schema

Several output streams are available from this source:
