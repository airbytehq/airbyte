## Setting permissions for API Keys
You can specify which API endpoints your API keys have access to from the Greenhouse Dev Center. This will allow you to permit or deny access to each endpoint individually. Any API keys created before January 18th, 2017 will have full permissions to all API endpoints that existed at that time, but any new API keys created after that point will need to be explicitly granted the required endpoint permissions.
To add or remove endpoint permissions on an API key, go to the Dev Center in Greenhouse, click “API Credential Management,” then click “Manage Permissions” next to your Harvest API Key. From there, check or uncheck permissions for any endpoints.

**Important Note**: Users with Harvest API keys may access all the data in the endpoint. Access to data in Harvest is binary: everything or nothing. Harvest API keys should be given to internal developers with this understanding and to third parties with caution. Each key should only be allowed to access the endpoints it absolutely needs.
See more on this [here](https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html#authentication).

## Performance considerations

The Greenhouse connector should not run into Greenhouse API limitations under normal usage. 
Please [create an issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues) if you see any rate limit issues that are not automatically retried successfully.
