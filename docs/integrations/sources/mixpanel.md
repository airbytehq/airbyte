# Mixpanel

## Overview

The Mixpanel source supports Full Refresh syncs. That is, every time a sync is run, Airbyte will copy all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication into the destination in a new table.

This Hubspot source wraps the [Singer Mixpanel Tap](https://github.com/singer-io/tap-mixpanel).

### Output schema

* [Export](https://developer.mixpanel.com/docs/exporting-raw-data#section-export-api-reference)
