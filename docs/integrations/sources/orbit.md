### Performance considerations / Rate Limiting

The Orbit API is rate limited at 120 requests per IP per minute as stated [here](https://docs.orbit.love/reference/rate-limiting).

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues) if you see any rate limit issues that are not automatically retried successfully.
