# Google Ads Migration Guide

## Upgrading to 1.0.0

This release introduced fixes to the creation of custom query schemas. For instance, the field ad_group_ad.ad.final_urls in the custom query has had its type changed from `{"type": "string"}` to `{"type": ["null", "array"], "items": {"type": "string"}}`. Users should refresh their schemas and data before updating.
