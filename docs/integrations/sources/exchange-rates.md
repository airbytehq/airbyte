# Exchange Rates API

<HideInUI>

This page contains the setup guide and reference information for the [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) source connector.

</HideInUI>

## Overview

The Exchange Rates API integration is a toy integration to demonstrate how Airbyte works with a very simple source.

## Prerequisites

- Exchange Rates API account
- API Access Key

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Set up Exchange Rates API

1. Create an account with [Exchange Rates API](https://manage.exchangeratesapi.io/signup/).
2. Navigate to the [Exchange Rates API Dashboard](https://manage.exchangeratesapi.io/dashboard) to find your `API Access Key`.

:::note
If you have a `free` subscription plan, you will have two limitations to the plan:

1. Limit of 1,000 API calls per month
2. You won't be able to specify the `base` parameter, meaning that you will be only be allowed to use the default base value which is `EUR`.
:::

### Step 2: Set up the Exchange Rates connector in Airbyte

1. Enter a **Name** for your source.
2. Enter your **API key** as the `access_key` from the prerequisites.
3. Enter the **Start Date** in YYYY-MM-DD format. The data added on and after this date will be replicated.
4. (Optional) Enter a **base** currency. For those on the free plan, `EUR` is the only option available. If none are specified, `EUR` will be used.
5. Click **Set up source**.

### Connector limitations

#### Rate limiting

The Exchange Rates API has rate limits that vary per pricing plan. The free plan is subject to rate limiting of 1,000 requests per month. Review the [Exchange Rates API Pricing Plans](https://exchangeratesapi.io/#pricing_plan) for more information.

### Troubleshooting

* With the free plan, you won't be able to specify the `base` parameter, meaning that you will be only be allowed to use the default base value which is `EUR`.
