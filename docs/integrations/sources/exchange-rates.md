# Exchange Rates API

## Overview

The exchange rates integration is a toy integration to demonstrate how Airbyte works with a very simple source.

It pulls all its data from [https://exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io)

#### Output schema

It contains one stream: `exchange_rates`

Each record in the stream contains many fields:

- The date of the record
- One field for every supported [currency](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html) which contain the value of that currency on that date.

#### Data type mapping

Currencies are `number` and the date is a `string`.

#### Features

| Feature                   | Supported? |
| :------------------------ | :--------- |
| Full Refresh Sync         | Yes        |
| Incremental - Append Sync | Yes        |
| Namespaces                | No         |

### Getting started

### Requirements

- API Access Key

### Setup guide

In order to get an `API Access Key` please go to [this](https://manage.exchangeratesapi.io/signup/free) page and enter needed info. After registration and login you will see your `API Access Key`, also you may find it [here](https://manage.exchangeratesapi.io/dashboard).

If you have `free` subscription plan \(you may check it [here](https://manage.exchangeratesapi.io/plan)\) this means that you will have 2 limitations:

1. 1000 API calls per month.
2. You won't be able to specify the `base` parameter, meaning that you will be dealing only with default base value which is EUR.
