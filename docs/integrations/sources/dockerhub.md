# Dockerhub

## Sync overview

This source can sync data for the DockerHub API. It currently supports only [listing public repos](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/12773) and Full Refresh syncing for now. You supply a `docker_username`, and it will sync down all info about repos published under that name.

### Output schema

This Source is capable of syncing the following Streams:

- DockerHub

### Features

| Feature           | Supported?\(Yes/No\) | Notes |
| :---------------- | :------------------- | :---- |
| Full Refresh Sync | Yes                  |       |
| Incremental Sync  | No                   |       |
| Namespaces        | No                   |       |

### Performance considerations

This connector has been tested for the Airbyte organization, which has 266 repos, and works fine. It should not run into limitations under normal usage. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues) if you see any rate limit issues that are not automatically retried successfully.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- None

### Setup guide

1. Define a `docker_username`: the username that the connector will pull all repo data from.
