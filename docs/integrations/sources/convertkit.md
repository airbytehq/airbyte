## Sync overview

This source can sync data from the [ConvertKit API](https://developers.convertkit.com/#getting-started). At present this connector only supports full refresh syncs meaning that each time you use the connector it will sync all available records from scratch. Please use cautiously if you expect your API to have a lot of records.
