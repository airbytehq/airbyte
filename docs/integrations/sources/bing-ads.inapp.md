## Prerequisites
* [Microsoft developer token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/get-started?view=bingads-13#get-developer-token) of an authorized Bing Ads OAuth application

To use the Bing Ads API, you must have a developer token and valid user credentials. You will need to register an OAuth app to get a refresh token.
1. [Register your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/authentication-oauth-register?view=bingads-13) in the Azure portal.
2. [Request user consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/authentication-oauth-consent?view=bingads-13l) to get the authorization code.
3. Use the authorization code to [get a refresh token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/authentication-oauth-get-tokens?view=bingads-13).

:::note

The refresh token expires every 90 days. Repeat the authorization process to get a new refresh token. The full authentication process described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/get-started?view=bingads-13#access-token).
Please be sure to authenticate with the email (personal or work) that you used to sign in to the Bing ads/Microsoft ads platform.

## Setup guide
1. Enter a name for your source.

The custom tenant is used in the authentication URL, for example: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`

4. For **Replication Start Date**, enter the date in YYYY-MM-DD format. The data added on and after this date will be replicated. If this field is blank, Airbyte will replicate all data.

If your conversion window has an hours/minutes granularity, round it up to the number of days exceeding.
