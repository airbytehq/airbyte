# End-to-End Testing Source for Cloud

## Overview

This is a mock source for testing the Airbyte pipeline. It can generate arbitrary data streams. It is a subset of what is in [End-to-End Testing Source](e2e-test.md) in Open-Source to avoid Airbyte Cloud users accidentally in curring a huge bill.

## Mode

### Continuous Feed

This mode allows users to specify a single-stream or multi-stream catalog with arbitrary schema. The schema should be compliant with Json schema [draft-07](https://json-schema.org/draft-07/json-schema-release-notes.html).

The single-stream catalog config exists just for convenient, since in many testing cases, one stream is enough. If only one stream is specified in the multi-stream catalog config, it is equivalent to a single-stream catalog config.

Here is its configuration:

| Mock Catalog Type | Parameters          | Type    | Required | Default             | Notes                                                                                                                                                   |

| Single-stream     | stream name         | string  | yes      |                     | Name of the stream in the catalog.                                                                                                                      |

|                   | stream duplication  | integer | no       | 1                   | Duplicate the stream N times to quickly create a multi-stream catalog.                                                                                  |
| Multi-stream      | streams and schemas | json    | yes      |                     | A Json object specifying multiple data streams and their schemas. Each key in this object is one stream name. Each value is the schema for that stream. |
| Both              | max records         | integer | yes      | 100                 | The number of record messages to emit from this connector. Min 1. Max 100 billion.                                                                      |
|                   | random seed         | integer | no       | current time millis | The seed is used in random Json object generation. Min 0. Max 1 million.                                                                                |
