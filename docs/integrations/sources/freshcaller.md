# Freshcaller

## Overview

The Freshcaller source supports full refresh and incremental sync. Depending on your needs, one could choose appropriate sync mode - `full refresh` replicates all records every time a sync happens where as `incremental` replicates net-new records since the last successful sync.

### Output schema

The following endpoints are supported from this source:

* [Users](https://developers.freshcaller.com/api/#users)
* [Teams](https://developers.freshcaller.com/api/#teams)
* [Calls](https://developers.freshcaller.com/api/#calls)
* [Call Metrics](https://developers.freshcaller.com/api/#call-metrics)

If there are more endpoints you'd like Airbyte to support, please [create an issue.](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/new/choose)
