# Harvest Migration Guide

## Upgrading to 1.0.0

This update results in a change the following streams, requiring them to be cleared and completely synced again:
- `expenses_clients`
- `expenses_categories`
- `expenses_projects`
- `expenses_team`
- `time_clients`
- `time_projects`
- `time_tasks`
- `time_team`
- `uninvoiced`
- `estimate_messages`
- `invoice_payments`
- `invoice_messages`
- `project_assignments`

We're continuously striving to enhance the quality and reliability of our connectors at Airbyte. As part of our commitment to delivering exceptional service, we are transitioning the source Harvest from the Python Connector Development Kit (CDK) to our new low-code framework to improve maintainability and reliability of the connector. However, due to differences between the Python and low-code CDKs, this migration constitutes a breaking change.
