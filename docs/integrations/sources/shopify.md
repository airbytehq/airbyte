# Shopify

## Sync overview

The Shopify source supports both Full Refresh and Incremental syncs. You can choose if this connector will copy only the new or updated data, or all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication, every time a sync is run.

This source can sync data for the [Shopify API](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference).

This Source Connector is based on a [Airbyte CDK](https://docs.airbyte.io/connector-development/cdk-python).

### Output schema

This Source is capable of syncing the following core Streams:

* [Abandoned Checkouts](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/orders/abandoned_checkouts)
* [Collects](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/products/collect)
* [Custom Collections](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/products/customcollection)
* [Customers](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/customers)
* [Draft Orders](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/orders/draftorder)
* [Discount Codes](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/discounts/discountcode)
* [Metafields](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/metafield)
* [Orders](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/orders)
* [Orders Refunds](https://shopify.dev/api/admin/rest/reference/orders/refund)
* [Orders Risks](https://shopify.dev/api/admin/rest/reference/orders/order-risk)
* [Products](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/products)
* [Transactions](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/orders/transaction)
* [Pages](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/online-store/page)
* [Price Rules](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/discounts/pricerule)

#### NOTE: 
For better experience with `Incremental Refresh` the follwing is recomended:
* `Order Refunds`, `Order Risks`, `Transactions` should be synced along with `Orders` stream.
* `Discount Codes` should be synced along with `Price Rules` stream.

If child streams are synced alone from the parent stream - the full sync will take place, and the records are filtered out afterwards.

### Data type mapping

| Integration Type | Airbyte Type | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `string` | `string` |  |
| `number` | `number` |  |
| `array` | `array` |  |
| `object` | `object` |  |

### Features

| Feature | Supported?\(Yes/No\) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Full Refresh Sync | Yes |  |
| Incremental - Append Sync | Yes |  |
| Namespaces | No |  |

### Performance considerations

Shopify has some [rate limit restrictions](https://shopify.dev/concepts/about-apis/rate-limits).
Typically, there should not be issues with throttling or exceeding the rate limits but in some edge cases, user can receive the warning message as follows:
```
"Caught retryable error '<some_error> or null' after <some_number> tries. Waiting <some_number> seconds then retrying..."
```
This is expected when the connector hits the 429 - Rate Limit Exceeded HTTP Error.
With given error message the sync operation is still goes on, but will require more time to finish.

## Getting started

1. Go to `https://YOURSTORE.myshopify.com/admin/apps/private`
2. Enable private development if it isn't enabled.
3. Create a private application.
4. Select the resources you want to allow access to. Airbyte only needs read-level access. 
   * Note: The UI will show all possible data sources and will show errors when syncing if it doesn't have permissions to access a resource. 
5. The password under the `Admin API` section is what you'll use as the `api_password` for the integration.
6. You're ready to set up Shopify in Airbyte!
