# Shopify

## Sync overview

The Shopify source supports both Full Refresh and Incremental syncs. You can choose if this connector will copy only the new or updated data, or all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication, every time a sync is run.

This source can sync data for the [Shopify API](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference).

This Source Connector is based on a [Airbyte CDK](https://docs.airbyte.io/contributing-to-airbyte/python).

### Output schema

This Source is capable of syncing the following core Streams:

* [Abandoned Checkouts](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/orders/abandoned_checkouts)
* [Collects](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/products/collect)

### Data type mapping

| Integration Type | Airbyte Type | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `string` | `string` |  |
| `number` | `number` |  |
| `array` | `array` |  |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Full Refresh Sync | Yes |  |

### Performance considerations

Shopify has some [rate limit restrictions](https://shopify.dev/concepts/about-apis/rate-limits).

## Getting started

1. Go to `https://YOURSTORE.myshopify.com/admin/apps/private`
2. Enable private development if it isn't enabled.
3. Create a private application.
4. Select the resources you want to allow access to. Airbyte only needs read-level access. 
   * Note: The UI will show all possible data sources and will show errors when syncing if it doesn't have permissions to access a resource. 
5. The password under the `Admin API` section is what you'll use as the `api_password` for the integration.
6. You're ready to set up Shopify in Airbyte!
