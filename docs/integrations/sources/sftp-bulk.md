# SFTP Bulk

<HideInUI>

This page contains the setup guide and reference information for the [SFTP Bulk](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/sftp-bulk#file-specific-configuration) source connector.

</HideInUI>

The SFTP Bulk connector offers several features that are not available in the standard SFTP source connector:

- **Bulk ingestion of files**: This connector can consolidate and process multiple files as a single data stream in your destination system.
- **Incremental loading**: This connector supports incremental loading, allowing you to sync files from the SFTP server to your destination based on their creation or last modification time.
- **Load most recent file**: You can choose to load only the most recent file from the designated folder path. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with snapshot files that are regularly added and contain the latest data.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a remote server that supports SFTP
- Host address
- Valid username and authentication credentials (password or SSH private key)

## Setup guide

### Set up SFTP Bulk

#### Step 1: Set up SFTP authentication

To set up the SFTP connector, select _one_ of the following authentication methods:

- Your username and password credentials associated with the server.
- A private/public key pair.

To set up key pair authentication, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate a new key pair.
   :::note
   If your operating system does not support the `ssh-keygen` command, you can use a third-party tool like [PuTTYgen](https://www.puttygen.com/) to generate the key pair instead.
   :::

2. You will be prompted for a location to save the keys, and a passphrase to secure the private key. You can press enter to accept the default location and opt out of a passphrase if desired. Your two keys will be generated in the designated location as two separate files. The private key will usually be saved as `id_rsa`, while the public key will be saved with the `.pub` extension (`id_rsa.pub`).

3. Use the `ssh-copy-id` command in your terminal to copy the public key to the server.

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id <username>@<server_ip_address>
   ```

   Be sure to replace your specific values for your username and the server's IP address.

   :::note
   Depending on factors such as your operating system and the specific SSH implementation your remote server uses, you may not be able to use the `ssh-copy-id` command. If so, please consult your server administrator for the appropriate steps to copy the public key to the server.
   :::

4. You should now be able to connect to the server via the private key. You can test this by using the `ssh` command:

```bash
ssh <username>@<server_ip_address>
```

For more information on SSH key pair authentication, please refer to the
[official documentation](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen).

### Set up the SFTP Bulk connector in Airbyte

### For Airbyte Cloud

1. [Log into your Airbyte Cloud](https://cloud.airbyte.com/workspaces) account.
2. Click Sources and then click + New source.
3. On the Set up the source page, select SFTP Bulk from the Source type dropdown.
4. Enter a name for the SFTP Bulk connector.
5. Choose a [delivery method](../../platform/using-airbyte/delivery-methods) for your data.
6. Enter the **Host Address**.
7. Enter your **Username**
8. Enter your authentication credentials for the SFTP server (**Password** or **Private Key**). If using Private Key authentication, see the SSH Key Authentication Setup section below for detailed instructions.
9. In the section titled `The list of streams to sync`, enter a **Stream Name**. This is the name of the stream that is created in your destination. Add additional streams by clicking **Add**.
10. For each stream, select in the dropdown menu the **File Type** you wish to sync. Depending on the format chosen, you'll see a set of options specific to the file type. You can read more about specifics to each file type below.
11. (Optional) Provide a **Start Date** using the provided datepicker, or by entering the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ`. Incremental syncs will only sync files modified/added after this date.
12. (Optional) Specify the **Port**. The default port for SFTP is 22. If your remote server is using a different port, enter it here.
13. (Optional) Determine the **Folder Path**. This determines the directory to search for files in, and defaults to "/". If you prefer to specify a specific folder path, specify the directory on the remote server to be synced. For example, given the file structure:

    ```text
    Root
    | - logs
    |   | - 2021
    |   | - 2022
    |
    | - files
    |   | - 2021
    |   | - 2022
    ```

    An input of `/logs/2022` replicates only data contained within the specified folder, ignoring the `/files` and `/logs/2021` folders. Leaving this field blank replicates all applicable files in the remote server's designated entry point.

14. Click **Set up source** to complete setup. A test runs to verify the configuration.

#### SSH Key Authentication Setup

If your SFTP server uses SSH key-based authentication, you'll need to provide your private key file (`.pem` or similar format) during setup. Follow these steps to create and upload it correctly:

1. **Locate your private key text.** This is the block of text that begins with `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` or `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and ends with `-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` or `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

2. **Create a PEM file:**
   1. Open any text editor or IDE (for example, PyCharm, VS Code, or a terminal text editor).
   2. Create a new file named `ssh.pem`.
   3. Paste the entire private key text into the file, including the BEGIN and END lines.
   4. Make sure there are no quotes or extra spaces before or after the key.
   5. Save the file.

3. **(Optional but recommended)** If you're on macOS or Linux, set restricted permissions so only you can read it:

   ```bash
   chmod 600 ssh.pem
   ```

4. **Upload the file in Airbyte Cloud:**
   1. In the SFTP Bulk source setup form, find the **Private key** field.
   2. Click **Upload file** and select your saved `ssh.pem` file.

Once uploaded, Airbyte uses this file to authenticate securely with your SFTP server.

:::note
The file must be in PEM format, a plain text file containing your private key between the BEGIN and END lines. Do not paste the key directly into the field; Airbyte requires a file upload.
:::

### For Airbyte Open Source

1. Navigate to the Airbyte Open Source dashboard.
2. Click Sources and then click + New source.
3. On the Set up the source page, select SFTP Bulk from the Source type dropdown.
4. Enter a name for the SFTP Bulk connector.

## Delivery Method

<FieldAnchor field="delivery_method.delivery_type">

Choose a [delivery method](../../platform/using-airbyte/delivery-methods) for your data.

</FieldAnchor>

### Preserve Sub-Directories in File Paths

If enabled, sends subdirectory folder structure along with source file names to the destination. Otherwise, files are synced by their names only. This option is ignored when file-based replication is not enabled.

## File-specific Configuration

Depending on your **File Type** selection, you are presented with a few configuration options specific to that file type.

For JSONL, Parquet, and Document File Type formats, you can specify the **Glob** pattern used to specify which files should be selected from the file system. If your provided Folder Path already ends in a slash, you need to add that double slash to the glob where appropriate.

For example, assuming your folder path is not set in the connector configuration and your files are located in the root folder, use a glob pattern like `//my_prefix_*.csv` to specify your file. If your files are in a folder, include the folder in your glob pattern, like `//my_folder/my_prefix_*.csv`.

If your files are in a folder, include the folder in your glob pattern, like `my_folder/my_prefix_*.csv`.

## Supported sync modes

The SFTP Bulk source connector supports the following [sync modes](https://docs.airbyte.com/cloud/core-concepts/#connection-sync-modes):

| Feature                        | Support | Notes |
|:-------------------------------|:-------:|:------|
| Full Refresh - Overwrite       |    ✅    |       |
| Full Refresh - Append Sync     |    ✅    |       |
| Incremental - Append           |    ✅    |       |
| Incremental - Append + Deduped |    ❌    |       |

## Supported Streams

This source provides a single stream per file with a dynamic schema. The current supported type files are Avro, CSV, JSONL, Parquet, and Document File Type Format.

## File Size Limitations

When using the SFTP Bulk connector with the **Copy Raw Files** delivery method, individual files are subject to a maximum size limit of 1.5 GB (1,500,000,000 bytes) per file. This limitation applies to the raw file transfer process where files are copied without parsing their contents.

If you need to sync files larger than 1.5 GB, consider the following approach:

- Split large files into smaller chunks before uploading them to your SFTP server

The **Replicate Records** delivery method is not a workaround for large file sizes. Replicate Records only works with structured file formats (CSV, JSONL, Parquet, Avro, etc.) that the connector can parse into individual records. It does not support unstructured files or binary formats, and files processed through Replicate Records are still subject to the same size limitations.

For more information about delivery methods and their limitations, see the [Delivery Methods documentation](/platform/using-airbyte/delivery-methods#supported-versions-and-limitations).
