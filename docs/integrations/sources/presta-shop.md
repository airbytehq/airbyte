# PrestaShop

## Overview

The PrestaShop source supports both Full Refresh and Incremental syncs. You can choose if this connector will copy only the new or updated data, or all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication, every time a sync is run.

## Getting started

PrestaShop enables merchants to give third-party tools access to their shopâ€™s database through a CRUD API, otherwise called a [web service](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/webservice/).

By default, the webservice feature is disabled on PrestaShop and needs to be [switched on](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/webservice/tutorials/creating-access/#enable-the-webservice) before the first use.

### Requirements

* PrestaShop [access key](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/webservice/tutorials/creating-access/#create-an-access-key)
* PrestaShop url
