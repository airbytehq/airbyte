This page guides you through the process of setting up the LinkedIn Ads source connector.

## Prerequisites

<!-- env:cloud -->
**For Airbyte Cloud:**

* The LinkedIn Ads account with permission to access data from accounts you want to sync.
<!-- /env:cloud -->

<!-- env:oss -->
**For Airbyte Open Source:**

* The LinkedIn Ads account with permission to access data from accounts you want to sync.
* Authentication Options:
   * OAuth2.0:
      * `Client ID` from your `Developer Application`
      * `Client Secret` from your `Developer Application`
      * `Refresh Token` obtained from successful authorization with `Client ID` + `Client Secret`
   * Access Token:
      * `Access Token` obtained from successful authorization with `Client ID` + `Client Secret`
<!-- /env:oss -->

## Step 1: Set up LinkedIn Ads

1. [Login to LinkedIn](https://developer.linkedin.com/) with a developer account.
2. Click the **Create App** icon on the center of the page or [use here](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps). Fill in the required fields:  
    1. For **App Name**, enter a name.
    2. For **LinkedIn Page**, enter your company's name or LinkedIn Company Page URL.
    3. For **Privacy policy URL**, enter the link to your company's privacy policy.
    4. For **App logo**, upload your company's logo.
    5. For **Legal Agreement**, select **I have read and agree to these terms**.
    6. Click **Create App**, on the bottom right of the screen. LinkedIn redirects you to a page showing the details of your application.

3. Verify your app. You can verify your app using the following steps:
    1. To display the settings page, click the **Settings** tab. On the **App Settings** section, click **Verify** under **Company**. A popup window will be displayed. To generate the verification URL, click on **Generate URL**, then copy and send the URL to the Page Admin (this may be you). Click on **I'm done**.
    If you are the administrator of your Page, simply run the URL in a new tab (if not, an administrator will have to do the next step). Click on **Verify**. Finally, Refresh the tab of app creation, the app should now be associated with your Page.

    2.  To display the Products page, click the **Product** tab. For **Marketing Developer Platform** click on the **Request access**. A popup window will be displayed. Review and Select **I have read and agree to these terms**. Finally, click **Request access**. 
    
    3. To authorize your application, click the **Auth** tab. The authentication page is displayed. Copy the **client_id** and **client_secret** (for later steps). For **Oauth 2.0 settings**, Provide a **redirect_uri** (for later steps).
    
    4. Click and review the **Analytics** tab. This page shows the daily application and user/member limits with the percent used for each resource endpoint.


4. (Optional for Airbyte Cloud) Authorize your app. In case your authorization expires:

   The authorization token `lasts 60-days before expiring`. The connector app will need to be reauthorized when the authorization token expires.
   Create an Authorization URL with the following steps:

   1. Replace the highlighted parameters `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI` in the URL (`https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&scope=r_emailaddress,r_liteprofile,r_ads,r_ads_reporting,r_organization_social`) from the scope obtain below.

   2. Set up permissions for the following scopes `r_emailaddress,r_liteprofile,r_ads,r_ads_reporting,r_organization_social`. For **OAuth2.0**, copy the `Client ID`, and `Client Secret` from your `Developer Application`. And copy the `Refresh Token` obtained from successful authorization with `Client ID` + `Client Secret`

   3. Enter the modified `URL` in the browser. You will be redirected.

   4. To authorize the app, click **Allow**.

   5. Copy the `code` parameter listed in the redirect URL in the Browser header URL.
   
5. (Optional for Airbyte Cloud) Run the following curl command using `Terminal` or `Command line` with the parameters replaced to return your `access_token`. The `access_token` expires in 2-months.

   ```text
    curl -0 -v -X POST https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken\
    -H "Accept: application/json"\
    -H "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"\
    -d "grant_type=authorization_code"\
    -d "code=YOUR_CODE"\
    -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID"\
    -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"\
    -d "redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"
   ```

6. (Optional for Airbyte Cloud) Use the `access_token`. Same as the approach in  `Step 5` to authorize LinkedIn Ads connector.


### Notes:

The API user account should be assigned the following permissions for the API endpoints:
Endpoints such as: `Accounts`, `Account Users`, `Ad Direct Sponsored Contents`, `Campaign Groups`, `Campaigns`, and `Creatives` requires the following permissions set:

- `r_ads`: read ads \(Recommended\), `rw_ads`: read-write ads
  Endpoints such as: `Ad Analytics by Campaign`, and `Ad Analytics by Creatives` requires the following permissions set:
- `r_ads_reporting`: read ads reporting
  The complete set of permissions is as follows:
- `r_emailaddress,r_liteprofile,r_ads,r_ads_reporting,r_organization_social`

The API user account should be assigned one of the following roles:

- ACCOUNT_BILLING_ADMIN
- ACCOUNT_MANAGER
- CAMPAIGN_MANAGER
- CREATIVE_MANAGER
- VIEWER \(Recommended\)

To edit these roles, sign in to Campaign Manager and follow [these instructions](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a496075).

5. Add your `Account IDs (Optional)` if required.
6. Click **Authenticate your account**.
7. Login and Authorize the LinkedIn Ads account

    2. For **Access Token:** Obtain the **Access Token** using **Set up LinkedIn Ads**  guide steps and paste it into the corresponding field.
7. Click **Set up source**.
<!-- /env:oss -->

## Supported Streams and Sync Modes

This Source is capable of syncing the following data as streams:

- [Ad Analytics by Creative](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/ads-reporting/ads-reporting?tabs=curl&view=li-lms-2023-05#ad-analytics)

| Sync Mode                                 | Supported?\(Yes/No\) |
|:------------------------------------------|:---------------------|
| Full Refresh Overwrite Sync               | Yes                  |
| Full Refresh Append Sync                  | Yes                  |
| Incremental - Append Sync                 | Yes                  |
| Incremental - Append + Deduplication Sync | Yes                  |

### NOTE:

The `Ad Direct Sponsored Contents` stream includes information about VIDEO ADS, as well as `SINGLE IMAGE ADS` and other directly sponsored ads your account might have.

For Analytics Streams such as `Ad Analytics by Campaign` and `Ad Analytics by Creative`, the `pivot` column name is renamed to `_pivot` to handle the data normalization correctly and avoid name conflicts with certain destinations.

### Data type mapping

| Integration Type | Airbyte Type | Notes                       |
|:-----------------|:-------------|:----------------------------|
| `number`         | `number`     | float number                |
| `integer`        | `integer`    | whole number                |
| `date`           | `string`     | FORMAT YYYY-MM-DD           |
| `datetime`       | `string`     | FORMAT YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm: ss |
| `array`          | `array`      |                             |
| `boolean`        | `boolean`    | True/False                  |
| `string`         | `string`     |                             |

### Performance considerations

LinkedIn Ads has Official Rate Limits for API Usage, [more information here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/api-guide/concepts/rate-limits?context=linkedin/marketing/context). Rate limited requests will receive a 429 response. These limits reset at midnight UTC every day. In rare cases, LinkedIn may also return a 429 response as part of infrastructure protection. API service will return to normal automatically. In such cases, you will receive the following error message:

```text
"Caught retriable error '<some_error> or null' after <some_number> tries. Waiting <some_number> seconds then retrying..."
```

This is expected when the connector hits the 429 - Rate Limit Exceeded HTTP Error. If the maximum available API requests capacity is reached, you will have the following message:

```text
"Max try rate limit exceeded..."
```

After 5 unsuccessful attempts - the connector will stop the sync operation. In such cases check your Rate Limits [on this page](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps) &gt; Choose your app &gt; Analytics.
