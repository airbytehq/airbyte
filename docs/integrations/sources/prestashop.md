2. To get access to the PrestaShop API you need to create an access key, please follow the instructions in this [documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/1.7/webservice/tutorials/creating-access/#create-an-access-key).

### Step 2: Set up the PrestaShop connector in Airbyte

**For Airbyte Cloud:**

1. [Log into your Airbyte Cloud](https://cloud.airbyte.com/workspaces) account.
2. In the left navigation bar, click **Sources**. In the top-right corner, click **+ new source**.
3. On the source setup page, select **PrestaShop** from the Source type dropdown and enter a name for this connector.
4. Enter the **Access Key** that you obtained.
