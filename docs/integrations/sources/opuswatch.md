## Unlock Horticultural Insights with Airbyte and OPUSWatch

**What is OPUSWatch?**
OPUSWatch is a smart wearable solution developed by OPUS Solutions B.V., based in the Netherlands. This innovative smartwatch is specifically designed for the horticulture industry to digitize and streamline various operational processes within greenhouses and nurseries. It empowers growers to gain real-time insights into their labor, productivity, and overall operations. Employees use the OPUSWatch to easily record their tasks, track their work on specific crops, and even manage orders directly from their wrist. This data is then fed into a central system for analysis and decision-making.
