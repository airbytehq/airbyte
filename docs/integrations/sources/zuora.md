# Zuora

## Sync overview

The Zuora source supports both Full Refresh and Incremental syncs. You can choose if this connector will copy only the new or updated data, or all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication, every time a sync is run.

Airbyte uses [REST API](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Introduction) to fetch data from Zuora. The REST API accepts [ZOQL \(Zuora Object Query Language\)](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/Query/Export_ZOQL), a SQL-like language, to export the data.

### Output schema

This Source is capable of syncing:

* standard objects available in Zuora account
* custom objects manually added by user, available in Zuora Account
* custom fields in both standard and custom objects, available in Zuora Account

The discovering of Zuora Account objects schema may take a while, if you add the connection for the first time, and/or you need to refresh your list of available streams. Please take your time to wait and don't cancel this operation, usually it takes up to 5-10 min, depending on number of objects available in Zuora Account.

### Note:

Some of the Zuora Objects may not be available for sync due to limitations of Zuora Supscription Plan, Permissions. For details refer to the [Availability of Data Source Objects](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL) section in the Zuora documentation.

### Performance considerations

If you experience the long time for sync operation, please consider:

* to increase the `window_in_days` parameter inside Zuora source configuration
* use the smaller date range by tuning `start_date` parameter.

### Note

Usually, the very first sync operation for all of the objects inside Zuora account takes up to 25-45-60 min, the more data you have, the more time you'll need.
