## Prerequisites

* An Active [Shopify store](https://www.shopify.com)

::: note

If you are already a Cloud user but still use the `API PASSWORD` authentication method (option), please make sure you've switched to the `OAuth2.0`, as far as the `API PASSWORD` is going to be deprecated soon for Cloud Users, but this option remains for `OSS` users.

:::

## Setup guide

### Connect using OAuth2.0
1. Click `Authenticate your Shopify account` to start the autentication.
2. Click `Install` to install Airbyte application.
3. Log in to your account, if not already.
4. Select the store you want to sync and review the consent.
5. Click on `Install` to finish the Installation.
6. Reveiew the `Shop Name` field for the chosen store for a sync.
7. Set the `Start Date` as the starting point for your data replication.
8. Click `Test and Save` to finish the source set up.

You're ready to set up Shopify in Airbyte!
