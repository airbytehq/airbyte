## Upgrading to 2.0.0
Version 2.0.0 introduces a number of changes to the JSON schemas of all streams. While most of these changes are additions of missing fields, some breaking changes have been introduced that will affect most streams. Users are advised that they should refresh their schemas and reset their data when upgrading to this version.
