# Weatherstack

## Overview

This source connector syncs data from the [Weatherstack API](http://api.weatherstack.com/). This API allows to obtain current, historical, location lookup, and weather forecast.

### Output schema

This source currently has four streams: `current`, `historical`, `forecast`, and `autocomplete`. The Current Weather API is available on all plans. The Historical Weather and Autocomplete API's are available on the standard plan and higher. The Forecast API is available on the Professional plan and higher. Examples of the data outputted by this stream are available [here](https://weatherstack.com/documentation).
