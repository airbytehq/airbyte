# Zoom Migration Guide

## Upgrading to 1.0.0

### Authentication

As of September 8, 2023, Zoom has [deprecated JWT](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/jwt-faq/) authentication and now supports Oauth instead.

### Creating a server-to-server OAuth app

To successfully migrate, please use [Zoom's migration guide](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/jwt-app-migration/) to create a new server-to-server OAuth app and generate the necessary credentials.

When creating the app, ensure you grant it access to the following scopes:

- user:read:admin
- meeting:read:admin
- webinar:read:admin
- chat_channel:read:admin
- report:read:admin

To successfully authenticate your connection in Airbyte, you will need to input the following OAuth credentials:

- client_id
- client_secret
- account_id
- authorization_endpoint

### Schema changes

The type of the 'meeting_id' field in Meeting Registration Questions stream has been changed from "string" to "integer". Users with existing connections that are syncing data from this stream should refresh their schemas and reset their data.

#### Refresh affected schemas and reset data

1. Select **Connections** in the main nav bar.
    1. Select the connection affected by the update.
2. Select the **Replication** tab.
    1. Select **Refresh source schema**.
    2. Select **OK**.

:::note
Any detected schema changes will be listed for your review.
:::

3. Select **Save changes** at the bottom of the page.
    1. Ensure the **Reset affected streams** option is checked.

:::note
Depending on destination type you may not be prompted to reset your data.
:::

4. Select **Save connection**. 

:::note
This will reset the data in your destination and initiate a fresh sync.
