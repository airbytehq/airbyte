# Amazon SQS

## Sync overview

This source will sync messages from an [SQS Queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sqs/index.html).

### Output schema

This source will output one stream for the configured SQS Queue.  
The stream record data will have three fields:
* id (a UUIDv4 as a STRING)
* body (message body as a STRING)
* attributes (attributes of the messages as an OBJECT or NULL)

### Features

| Feature | Supported?\(Yes/No\) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Full Refresh Sync | yes |  |
| Incremental Sync | no |  |
| Namespaces | no |  |

### Performance considerations

## Getting started

### Requirements

* AWS IAM Access Key
* AWS IAM Secret Key
* AWS SQS Queue

### Properties

Required properties are 'Queue URL', 'AWS Region' and 'Delete Messages After Read' as noted in **bold** below.

* **Queue URL** (STRING)
  * The full AWS endpoint URL of the queue e.g. `https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/1234567890/example-queue-url`
* **AWS Region** (STRING)
  * The region code for the SQS Queue e.g. eu-west-1
* **Delete Messages After Read** (BOOLEAN)
  * **WARNING:** Setting this option to TRUE can result in data loss, do not enable this option unless you understand the risk. See the **Data loss warning** section below.
  * Should the message be deleted from the SQS Queue after being read? This prevents the message being read more than once
  * By default messages are NOT deleted, thus can be re-read after the `Message Visibility Timeout`
  * Default: False
* Max Batch Size (INTEGER)
  * The max amount of messages to consume in a single poll e.g. 5
  * Minimum of 1, maximum of 10
  * Default: 10
* Max Wait Time (INTEGER)
  * The max amount of time (in seconds) to poll for messages before commiting a batch (or timing out) unless we fill a batch (as per `Max Batch Size`)
  * Minimum of 1, maximum of 20
  * Default: 20
* Message Attributes To Return (STRING)
  * A comma separated list of Attributes to return for each message
  * Default: All
* Message Visibility Timeout (INTEGER)
  * After a message is read, how much time (in seconds) should the message be hidden from other consumers
  * After this timeout, the message is not deleted and can be re-read
  * Default: 30
* AWS IAM Access Key ID (STRING)
  * The Access Key for the IAM User with permissions on this Queue
  * If `Delete Messages After Read` is `false` then only `sqs:ReceiveMessage`
  * If `Delete Messages After Read` is `true` then `sqs:DeleteMessage` is also needed
* AWS IAM Secret Key (STRING)
  * The Secret Key for the IAM User with permissions on this Queue

### Data loss warning

When enabling **Delete Messages After Read**, the Source will delete messages from the SQS Queue after reading them. The message is deleted *after* the configured Destination takes the message from this Source, but makes no guarentee that the downstream destination has commited/persisted the message. This means that it is possible for the Airbyte Destination to read the message from the Source, the Source deletes the message, then the downstream application fails - resulting in the message being lost permanently.

Extra care should be taken to understand this risk before enabling this option.

### Setup guide

* [Create IAM Keys](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/)
* [Create SQS Queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-getting-started.html#step-create-queue)

> **NOTE**:
> * If `Delete Messages After Read` is `false` then the IAM User needs only `sqs:ReceiveMessage` in the AWS IAM Policy
> * If `Delete Messages After Read` is `true` then both `sqs:ReceiveMessage` and `sqs:DeleteMessage` are needed in the AWS IAM Policy
