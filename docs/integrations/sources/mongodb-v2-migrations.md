# MongoDb Migration Guide

## Upgrading to 1.0.0

This version introduces a general availability version of the MongoDB V2 source connector, which leverages 
[Change Data Capture (CDC)](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/cdc) to improve the performance and 
reliability of syncs.  This version provides better error handling, incremental delivery of data and improved 
reliability of large syncs via frequent checkpointing.  

**THIS VERSION INCLUDES BREAKING CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE CONNECTOR!**

The changes will require you to reconfigure your existing MongoDB V2 configured source connectors.  To review the 
breaking changes and to learn how to upgrade the connector, refer to the [MongoDB V2 source connector documentation](mongodb-v2#upgrade-from-previous-version).
Additionally, you can manually update existing connections prior to the next scheduled sync to perform the upgrade or 
re-create the source using the new configuration.

Worthy of specific mention, this version includes:

- Support for MongoDB replica sets only
- Use of Change Data Capture for incremental delivery of changes
- Frequent checkpointing of synced data
- Sampling of fields for schema discovery
- Required SSL/TLS connections
