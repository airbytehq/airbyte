# Harvest

## Overview

The Harvest connector can be used to sync your Harvest data. It supports full refresh sync for all streams and incremental sync for all streams except of Expense Reports streams which are: Clients Report, Projects Report, Categories Report, Team Report. Incremental sync is also now available for Company stream, but it always has only one record.
