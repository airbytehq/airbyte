### Performance considerations

The connector is restricted by normal Zendesk [requests limitation](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/account-configuration/usage_limits/)

The Zendesk connector should not run into Zendesk API limitations under normal usage. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues) if you see any rate limit issues that are not automatically retried successfully.

## Getting started

### Requirements

* Zendesk Sell API Token


### Setup guide

Please follow this [guide](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/custom-data/custom-objects/getting-started-with-custom-objects/#enabling-custom-objects)

Generate an API Token or oauth2.0 Access token as described in [here](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/introduction/#security-and-authentication)

We recommend creating a restricted, read-only key specifically for Airbyte access. This will allow you to control which resources Airbyte should be able to access.
