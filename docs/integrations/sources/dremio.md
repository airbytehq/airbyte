# Dremio

## Overview

The Dremio source supports Full Refresh sync. You can choose if this connector will copy only the new or updated data, or all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication, every time a sync is run.

### Output schema

Several output streams are available from this source:

- [Catalogs](https://docs.dremio.com/software/rest-api/catalog/get-catalog/) \(Full table\)

If there are more endpoints you'd like Airbyte to support, please [create an issue.](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/new/choose)

### Setup guide
Connector needs a self-hosted instance of Dremio, this way you can access the Dremio REST API on which this source is based. Please refer to [Dremio Deployment Models](https://docs.dremio.com/software/deployment/deployment-models/) document, or take a look at [Dremio OSS](https://github.com/dremio/dremio-oss) for reference.

Please read [How to get your APIs credentials](https://docs.dremio.com/software/rest-api/#authenticationn).
