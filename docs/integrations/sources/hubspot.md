### Performance considerations

The connector is restricted by normal Hubspot [rate limitations](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/apps/api_guidelines).

When connector reads the stream using `API Key` that doesn't have neccessary permissions to read particular stream, like `workflows`, which requires to be enabled in order to be processed, the log message returned to the output and sync operation goes on with other streams available.

Example of the output message when trying to read `workflows` stream with missing permissions for the `API Key`:
```
{
    "type": "LOG",
    "log": {
        "level": "WARN",
        "message": 'Stream `workflows` cannot be procced. This hapikey (EXAMPLE_API_KEY) does not have proper permissions! (requires any of [automation-access])'
    }
}
```

## Getting started


### Requirements

* Hubspot Account
* Api credentials

### Setup guide

{% hint style="info" %}
Hubspot's API will [rate limit](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/usage-details) the amount of records you can sync daily, so make sure that you are on the appropriate plan if you are planning on syncing more than 250,000 records per day.
{% endhint %}

This connector supports only authentication with API Key. To obtain API key for the account go to settings -&gt; integrations \(under the account banner\) -&gt; api key. If you already have an api key you can use that. Otherwise generated a new one. See [docs](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/integrations/how-do-i-get-my-hubspot-api-key) for more details.
