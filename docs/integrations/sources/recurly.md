# Recurly

## Overview

The Recurly source supports _Full Refresh_ as well as _Incremental_ syncs. 

_Full Refresh_ sync means every time a sync is run, Airbyte will copy all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication into the destination in a new table.
_Incremental_ syn means only changed resources are copied from Recurly. For the first run, it will be a Full Refresh sync.

### Output schema

* [Accounts](https://docs.recurly.com/docs/accounts)

### Performance considerations

The Recurly connector should not run into Recurly API limitations under normal usage. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues) if you see any rate limit issues that are not automatically retried successfully.

## Getting started

### Requirements

* Recurly Account
* Recurly API Key

### Setup guide

Generate a API key using the [Recurly documentation](https://docs.recurly.com/docs/api-keys#section-find-or-generate-your-api-key)

We recommend creating a restricted, read-only key specifically for Airbyte access. This will allow you to control which resources Airbyte should be able to access.
