# Freshdesk

## Overview

The Freshdesk source supports Full Refresh syncs. That is, every time a sync is run, Airbyte will copy all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication into the destination in a new table.

### Output schema

Several output streams are available from this source:

* [Agents](https://developers.freshdesk.com/api/#agents)
