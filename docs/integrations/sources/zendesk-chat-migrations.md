# Zendesk Chat Migration Guide

## Upgrading to 1.0.0

The Live Chat API [changed its URL structure](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/live-chat/introduction/) to use the Zendesk subdomain.
The `subdomain` field of the connector configuration is now required.
You can find your Zendesk subdomain by following instructions [here](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409381383578-Where-can-I-find-my-Zendesk-subdomain).
