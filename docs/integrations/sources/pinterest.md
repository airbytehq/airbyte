# Pinterest

## Overview

The Pinterest source supports both Full Refresh and Incremental syncs. You can choose if this connector will copy only the new or updated data, or all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication, every time a sync is run.

This Source Connector is based on a [Airbyte CDK](https://docs.airbyte.io/connector-development/cdk-python).

* [Account analytics](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/#operation/user_account/analytics) \(Incremental\)

### Performance considerations

The connector is restricted by normal Pinterest [requests limitation](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/#tag/Rate-limits).

#####  Rate Limits

Analytics streams - 300 calls per day / per user \
Ad accounts streams (Campaigns, Ad groups, Ads) - 1000 calls per min / per user / per app \
Boards streams - 10 calls per sec / per user / per app

The Pinterest connector should not run into Pinterest API limitations under normal usage. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues) if you see any rate limit issues that are not automatically retried successfully.
