# LinkedIn Pages

## Sync overview

The LinkedIn Pages source only supports Full Refresh for now. Incremental Sync will be coming soon.

Airbyte uses [LinkedIn Marketing Developer Platform - API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/marketing-integrations-overview) to fetch data from LinkedIn Pages.

### Output schema

This Source is capable of syncing the following data as streams:

* [Organization Lookup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/community-management/organizations/organization-lookup-api?tabs=http#retrieve-organizations)
* [Follower Statistics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/community-management/organizations/follower-statistics?tabs=http#retrieve-lifetime-follower-statistics)
* [Page Statistics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/community-management/organizations/page-statistics?tabs=http#retrieve-lifetime-organization-page-statistics)
* [Share Statistics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/community-management/organizations/share-statistics?tabs=http#retrieve-lifetime-share-statistics)
* [Shares (Latest 50)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/community-management/shares/share-api?tabs=http#find-shares-by-owner)
* [Total Follower Count](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/community-management/organizations/organization-lookup-api?tabs=http#retrieve-organization-follower-count)
* [UGC Posts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/community-management/shares/ugc-post-api?tabs=http#find-ugc-posts-by-authors)

### NOTE:

All streams only sync all-time statistics at this time. A `start_date` field will be added soon to pull data starting at a single point in time.

### Performance considerations

There are official Rate Limits for LinkedIn Pages API Usage, [more information here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/api-guide/concepts/rate-limits?context=linkedin/marketing/context). Rate limited requests will receive a 429 response. Rate limits specify the maximum number of API calls that can be made in a 24 hour period. These limits reset at midnight UTC every day. In rare cases, LinkedIn may also return a 429 response as part of infrastructure protection. API service will return to normal automatically. In such cases you will receive the next error message:

```text
"Caught retryable error '<some_error> or null' after <some_number> tries. Waiting <some_number> seconds then retrying..."
```

This is expected when the connector hits the 429 - Rate Limit Exceeded HTTP Error. If the maximum of available API requests capacity is reached, you will have the following message:

```text
"Max try rate limit exceded..."
```

After 5 unsuccessful attempts - the connector will stop the sync operation. In such cases check your Rate Limits [on this page](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps) &gt; Choose your app &gt; Analytics. 

## Getting started
The API user account should be assigned the following permissions for the API endpoints:
Endpoints such as: `Organization Lookup API`, `Follower Statistics`, `Page Statistics`, `Share Statistics`, `Shares`, `UGC Posts` require these permissions:
* `r_organization_social`: Retrieve your organization's posts, comments, reactions, and other engagement data.
* `rw_organization_admin`: Manage your organization's pages and retrieve reporting data.

The API user account should be assigned the `ADMIN` role.

### Authentication
There are 2 authentication methods: Access Token or OAuth2.0.
OAuth2.0 is recommended since it will continue streaming data for 12 months instead of 2 months with an access token.

##### Create the `Refresh_Token` or `Access_Token`:
The source LinkedIn Pages can use either the `client_id`, `client_secret` and `refresh_token` for OAuth2.0 authentication or simply use an `access_token` in the UI connector's settings to make API requests. Access tokens expire after `2 months from creation date (60 days)` and require a user to manually authenticate again. Refresh tokens expire after `12 months from creation date (365 days)`. If you receive a `401 invalid token response`, the error logs will state that your token has expired and to re-authenticate your connection to generate a new token. This is described more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow?context=linkedin/context).

1. **Log in to LinkedIn as the API user**

2. **Create an App** [here](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps):
   * `App Name`: airbyte-source
   * `Company`: search and find your LinkedIn Company Page
   * `Privacy policy URL`: link to company privacy policy
   * `Business email`: developer/admin email address
   * `App logo`: Airbyte's \(or Company's\) logo
   * Review/agree to legal terms and create app
   * Review the **Auth** tab:
     * **Save your `client_id` and `client_secret`** \(for later steps\)
     * Oauth 2.0 settings: Provide a `redirect_uri` \(for later steps\): `https://airbyte.com`

3. **Verify App**:
   * In the **Settings** tab of your app dashboard, you'll see a **Verify** button. Click that button!
   * Generate and provide the verify URL to your Company's LinkedIn Admin to verify the app.

4. **Request API Access**:
   * Navigate to the **Products** tab
   * Select the [Marketing Developer Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/) and agree to the legal terms
   * After a few minutes, refresh the page to see a link to `View access form` in place of the **Select** button
   * Fill out the access form and access should be granted **within 72 hours** (usually quicker)

5. **Create A Refresh Token** (or Access Token):
   * Navigate to the LinkedIn Developers' [OAuth Token Tools](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/tools/oauth) and click **Create token**
   * Select your newly created app and check the boxes for the following scopes:
     * `r_organization_social`
     * `rw_organization_admin`
   * Click **Request access token** and once generated, **save your Refresh token**

6. **Use the `client_id`, `client_secret` and `refresh_token`** from Steps 2 and 5 to autorize the LinkedIn Pages connector within the Airbyte UI.
   * As mentioned earlier, you can also simply use the Access token auth method for 60-day access.
