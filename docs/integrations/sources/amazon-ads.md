## Setup guide
### Step 1: Set up Amazon Ads
Create an [Amazon user](https://www.amazon.com) with access to [Amazon Ads account](https://advertising.amazon.com).

<!-- env:oss -->
**For Airbyte Open Source:**
To use the [Amazon Ads API](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us), you must first complete the [onboarding process](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/setting-up/overview). The onboarding process has several steps and may take several days to complete. After completing all steps you will have to get Amazon client application `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `Refresh Token`.
