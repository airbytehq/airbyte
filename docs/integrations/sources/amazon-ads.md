### Performance considerations

Information about expected report generation waiting time you may find [here](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/get-started/developer-notes).

## Getting started

### Requirements

* client\_id
* client\_secret
* refresh\_token
* scope
* profiles
* region
* start\_date \(optional\)

More how to get client\_id and client\_secret you can find on [AWS docs](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/setting-up/step-1-create-lwa-app).

Refresh token is generated according to standard [AWS Oauth 2.0 flow](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/conceptual-overview.html)

Scope usually has "advertising::campaign\_management" value, but customers may need to set scope to "cpc\_advertising:campaign\_management",

Start date used for generating reports starting from the specified start date. Should be in YYYY-MM-DD format and not more than 60 days in the past. If not specified today date is used. Date for specific profile is calculated according to its timezone, this parameter should be specified in UTC timezone. Since it have no sense of generate report for current day \(metrics could be changed\) it generates report for day before \(e.g. if start\_date is 2021-10-11 it would use 20211010 as reportDate parameter for request\).
