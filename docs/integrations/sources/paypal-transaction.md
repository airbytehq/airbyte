# Paypal Transaction

This page contains the setup guide and reference information for the Paypal Transaction source connector.

## Prerequisites

The [Paypal Transaction API](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/transaction-search/v1/) is used to get the history of transactions for a PayPal account.

## Setup guide
### Step 1: Set up Paypal Transaction

In order to get an `Client ID` and `Secret` please go to [this](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/platforms/get-started/) page and follow the instructions. After registration you may find your `Client ID` and `Secret` [here](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/accounts/).

:::note

Our Paypal Transactions Source Connector does not support OAuth at this time due to limitations outside of our control. If OAuth for Paypal Transactions is critical to your business, [please reach out to us](mailto:product@airbyte.io) to discuss how we may be able to partner on this effort.

## Supported sync modes

The PayPal Transaction source connector supports the following [sync modes](https://docs.airbyte.com/cloud/core-concepts#connection-sync-modes):

| Feature                   | Supported? |
| :------------------------ | :--------- |
| Full Refresh Sync         |    Yes     |
| Incremental - Append Sync |    Yes     |
| Namespaces                |     No     |

## Supported Streams

This Source is capable of syncing the following core Streams:

* [Transactions](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/transaction-search/v1/#transactions)
* [Balances](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/transaction-search/v1/#balances)

## Performance considerations

Paypal transaction API has some [limits](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/transaction-search/)

* `start_date_min` = 3 years, API call lists transaction for the previous three years.
* `start_date_max` = 1.5 days, it takes a maximum of three hours for executed transactions to appear in the list transactions call. It is set to 1.5 days by default based on experience, otherwise API throw an error.
* `stream_slice_period` = 1 day, the maximum supported date range is 31 days.
* `records_per_request` = 10000, the maximum number of records in a single request.
* `page_size` = 500, the maximum page size is 500.
* `requests_per_minute` = 30, maximum limit is 50 requests per minute from IP address to all endpoint

Transactions sync is performed with default `stream_slice_period` = 1 day, it means that there will be 1 request for each day between start_date and now or end_date. if `start_date` is greater then `start_date_max`. Balances sync is similarly performed with default `stream_slice_period` = 1 day, but it will do additional request for the end_date of the sync now.
