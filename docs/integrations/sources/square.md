## Performance considerations

No defined API rate limits were found in Square documentation however considering [this information](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28033966/whats-the-rate-limit-on-the-square-connect-api/28053836#28053836) it has 10 QPS limits. The connector doesn't handle rate limits exceptions, but no errors were raised during testing.

Some Square API endpoints has different page size limitation
