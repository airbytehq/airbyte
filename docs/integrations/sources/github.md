# Github

## Overview

The GitHub source supports both Full Refresh and Incremental syncs. You can choose if this connector will copy only the new or updated data, or all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication, every time a sync is run.

This Github source wraps the [Singer Github Tap](https://github.com/singer-io/tap-github).

### Performance considerations

The Github connector should not run into Github API limitations under normal usage. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues) if you see any rate limit issues that are not automatically retried successfully.

## Getting started

### Requirements

* Github Account
* Github Personal Access Token wih the necessary permissions \(described below\)

### Setup guide

Log into Github and then generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

Your token should have at least the `repo` scope. Depending on which streams you want to sync, the user generating the token needs more permissions:

* For syncing Collaborators, the user which generates the personal access token must be a collaborator. To become a collaborator, they must be invited by an owner. Read more about access permissions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/access-permissions-on-github).
* Syncing [Teams](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-teams) is only available to authenticated members of a team's [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/reference/orgs). [Personal user accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts) and repositories belonging to them don't have access to Teams features.
* To sync the Projects stream, the repository must have the Projects feature enabled.
