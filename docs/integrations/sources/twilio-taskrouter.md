# Twilio Taskrouter

This page contains the setup guide and reference information for the Twilio Taskrouter source connector.

## Prerequisites

Twilio Taskroute HTTP requests to the REST API are protected with HTTP Basic authentication. You will use your Twilio Account SID as the username and your Auth Token as the password for HTTP Basic authentication. You will also have to use your Workspace ID as the sid if you wish to access a particular workspace or it's subresources.

You can find your Account SID and Auth Token on your [dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/user/account) by scrolling down the console once you have created a Twilio account.
You can find [Taskrouter](https://console.twilio.com/develop/explore) in the Explore Products page under Solutions in the list. Click on it to expand a panel in the sidebar and click on Workspaces to be taken to your created workspaces. Each workspace has it's unique ID as SID with which you can access the streams.

See [docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/api) for more details.
