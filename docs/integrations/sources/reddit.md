# Reddit

## Overview

The Reddit source supports _Full Refresh_ as well as _Incremental_ syncs.

_Full Refresh_ sync means every time a sync is run, Airbyte will copy all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication into the destination in a new table.
_Incremental_ sync means only changed resources are copied from Reddit. For the first run, it will be a Full Refresh sync.


## Steps for getting `api_key`

You can make a POST request from Postman to exchange your Reddit username and password for an `api_key` authorized to make requests.

First make an app to get the client ID and secret for authentication:

1. Go to Reddit's App Preferences Page:
- Visit `https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps`, select `create another app` and input an app name. Select the `script` option and set the redirect URI as `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback`.

2. Copy Your App Credentials:
 - After creating the app, you will see the Client ID (below your app name) and Client Secret (labeled as "secret").
 - Client ID: Copy this value as it will be your Authorization Username in Postman.
 - Client Secret: Copy this value as it will be your Authorization Password in Postman.

3. Visit Postman via web or app and make a new request with following guidelines:
 - Request - POST `https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token`
 - Authorization - Basic Auth -`username: <YOUR_USERNAME>`, `password: <YOUR_PASSWORD>`
 - Body - x-www-form-urlencoded - `grant_type: password, username: YOUR_REDDIT_USERNAME, password: YOUR_REDDIT_PASSWORD`

Hit send to receive `api_key` in the response under `access_token`

## Records and rate limiting

- The Reddit API has [rate limiting of 100 queries per minute (QPM) per OAuth client ID](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/16160319875092-Reddit-Data-API-Wiki). It is handled with an exponential backoff strategy, with maximum 3 retries.
- If the `api_key` expires, a new access token will need to be generated through Postman.
- The Reddit API has a hard limit of fetching 1000 records per single stream call with subsequent pagination.
