# Jira Migration Guide

## Upgrading to 2.0.0

We're continuously striving to enhance the quality and reliability of our connectors at Airbyte. As part of our commitment to delivering exceptional service, we are transitioning source-jira from the Python Connector Development Kit (CDK) to our innovative low-code framework. This is part of a strategic move to streamline many processes across connectors, bolstering maintainability and freeing us to focus more of our efforts on improving the performance and features of our evolving platform and growing catalog. However, due to differences between the Python and low-code CDKs, this migration constitutes a breaking change.

To gracefully handle these changes for your existing connections, we highly recommend resetting your data before resuming your data syncs with the new version. The **Issues**, **Board Issues** and **Sprint Issues** streams can be manually reset in the following way:

1. Select **Connections** in the main navbar.
   1. Select the connection(s) affected by the update.
2. Select the **Schema** tab.
3. Uncheck all streams except the affected ones.
4. Select **Save changes** at the bottom of the page.
5. Select the **Settings** tab.
6. Press the **Clear your data** button.
7. Return to the **Schema** tab.
8. Check all your streams.
9. Select **Sync now** to sync your data

## Upgrading to 1.0.0

Note: this change is only breaking if you are using the `Boards Issues` stream in Incremental Sync mode.

2. Select the **Replication** tab.
