## Prerequisites
- Spreadsheet Link - The link to the Google spreadsheet you want to sync.
- A Google Workspace user with access to the spreadsheet

:::info
The Google Sheets source connector pulls data from a single Google Sheets spreadsheet. To replicate multiple spreadsheets, set up multiple Google Sheets source connectors in your Airbyte instance.
:::

## Setup guide

1. For **Source name**, enter a name to help you identify this source.
2. Select your authentication method:

<!-- env:cloud -->

#### For Airbyte Cloud

- **(Recommended)** Select **Authenticate via Google (OAuth)** from the Authentication dropdown, click **Sign in with Google** and complete the authentication workflow.

<!-- /env:cloud -->
<!-- env:oss -->

#### For Airbyte Open Source

- **(Recommended)** Select **Service Account Key Authentication** from the dropdown and enter your Google Cloud service account key in JSON format:

    ```js
    { "type": "service_account", "project_id": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", "private_key_id": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY", ... }
    ```

- To authenticate your Google account via OAuth, select **Authenticate via Google (OAuth)** from the dropdown and enter your Google application's client ID, client secret, and refresh token.

For detailed instructions on how to generate a service account key or OAuth credentials, refer to the [full documentation](https://docs.airbyte.io/integrations/sources/google-sheets#setup-guide).

<!-- /env:oss -->

3. For **Spreadsheet Link**, enter the link to the Google spreadsheet. To get the link, go to the Google spreadsheet you want to sync, click **Share** in the top right corner, and click **Copy Link**.
4. (Optional) You may enable the option to **Convert Column Names to SQL-Compliant Format**. Enabling this option will allow the connector to convert column names to a standardized, SQL-friendly format. For example, a column name of `Caf√© Earnings 2022` will be converted to `cafe_earnings_2022`. We recommend enabling this option if your target destination is SQL-based (ie Postgres, MySQL). Set to false by default.
5. Click **Set up source** and wait for the tests to complete.

### Output schema

- Airbyte only supports replicating [Grid](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/sheets#SheetType) sheets.

For detailed information on supported sync modes, supported streams, performance considerations, refer to the full documentation for [Google Sheets](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/google-sheets/).
