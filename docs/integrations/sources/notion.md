## Supported Streams

* [blocks](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-a-block)

* [pages](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-a-page)

## Performance considerations

The connector is restricted by normal Notion [rate limits and size limits](https://developers.notion.com/reference/errors#request-limits).

The Notion connector should not run into Notion API limitations under normal usage. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues) if you see any rate limit issues that are not automatically retried successfully.
