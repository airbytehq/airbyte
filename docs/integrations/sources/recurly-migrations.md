# Recurly Migration Guide

## Upgrading to 1.0.0

We recently rolled out an update to the Recurly connector using a newer version of our CDK, as well as introducing several additions to the existing stream schemas. Our aim with these updates is always to enhance the connector's functionality and provide you with a richer set of data to support your integration needs.

While our intention was to make these updates as seamless as possible, we've observed that some users are experiencing issues during the "Discover" step of the sync process. This has led us to re-categorize the recent changes as breaking updates, despite not removing fields or altering property names within the schema.

Once you have migrated to the new version, we highly recommend all users refresh their schemas and reset their data before resuming syncs
