# Zendesk Talk Migration Guide

import MigrationGuide from '@site/static/_migration_guides_upgrade_guide.md';

## Upgrading to 2.0.0

This version adds OAuth2.0 with refresh token support. Users who authenticate via OAuth must re-authenticate to use the new flow with rotating refresh tokens.

### What changed

The OAuth authentication flow has been updated to support Zendesk's new grant-type tokens with rotating refresh tokens. The legacy OAuth2.0 option has been renamed to "OAuth2.0 (Legacy)" and a new "OAuth2.0" option with refresh token support has been added.

### Migration steps

1. Go to your Zendesk Talk connection settings in Airbyte
2. If you are using OAuth authentication, you will need to re-authenticate
3. Select "OAuth2.0" as the authentication method
4. Complete the OAuth flow to authorize the connector

### Connector upgrade guide

<MigrationGuide />

## Upgrading to 1.0.0

We're continuously striving to enhance the quality and reliability of our connectors at Airbyte. As part of our commitment to delivering exceptional service, we are transitioning source zendesk-talk from the Python Connector Development Kit (CDK) to our innovative low-code framework. This is part of a strategic move to streamline many processes across connectors, bolstering maintainability and freeing us to focus more of our efforts on improving the performance and features of our evolving platform and growing catalog. However, due to differences between the Python and low-code CDKs, this migration constitutes a breaking change.

We’ve evolved and standardized how state is managed for incremental streams that are nested within a parent stream. This change impacts how individual states are tracked and stored for each partition, using a more structured approach to ensure the most granular and flexible state management. This change will affect the `calls` and `call_legs` streams.

To gracefully handle these changes for your existing connections, we highly recommend resetting your data before resuming your data syncs with the new version.
