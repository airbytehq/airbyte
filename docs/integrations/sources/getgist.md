# GetGist
An Airbyte connector for [Gist](https://getgist.com/) would enable data syncing between Gist and various data platforms or databases. This connector could pull data from key objects like contacts, tags, segments, campaigns, forms, and subscription types, facilitating integration with other tools in a data pipeline. By automating data extraction from Gist, users can analyze customer interactions and engagement more efficiently in their preferred analytics or storage environment.
