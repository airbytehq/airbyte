### Setup Guide

In order to obtain the Consumer Key and Access Token, please follow the official [Pocket Authentication docs](https://getpocket.com/developer/docs/authentication).

It's nevertheless, very recommended to follow [this guide](https://www.jamesfmackenzie.com/getting-started-with-the-pocket-developer-api/) by James Mackenzie, which is summarized below:

1. Create an App in the [Pocket Developer Portal](https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/new), give it Retrieve permissions and get your Consumer Key.
2. Obtain a Request Token. To do so, you need to issue a POST request to get a temporary Request Token. You can execute the command below:
```sh
curl --insecure -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Accept: application/json' \
    https://getpocket.com/v3/oauth/request  -d '{"consumer_key":"REPLACE-ME","redirect_uri":"http://www.google.com"}'
```
3. Visit the following website from your browser, and authorize the app: `https://getpocket.com/auth/authorize?request_token=REPLACE-ME&redirect_uri=http://www.google.com`
4. Convert your Request Token Into a Pocket Access Token. To do so, you can execute the following command:
```sh
curl --insecure -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Accept: application/json' \
    https://getpocket.com/v3/oauth/authorize  -d '{"consumer_key":"REPLACE-ME","code":"REQUEST-TOKEN"}'
```
