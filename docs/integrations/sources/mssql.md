The MSSQL source does not alter the schema present in your database. Depending on the destination connected to this source, however, the schema may be altered. See the destination's documentation for more details.

## Troubleshooting

You may run into an issue where the connector provides wrong values for some data types. See [discussion](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/4270) on unexpected behaviour for certain datatypes.

Note: Currently hierarchyid and sql_variant are not processed in CDC migration type (not supported by debezium). For more details please check
[this ticket](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/14411)


## Getting Started \(Airbyte Cloud\)

On Airbyte Cloud, only TLS connections to your MSSQL instance are supported in source configuration. Other than that, you can proceed with the open-source instructions below.

## Getting Started \(Airbyte Open-Source\)

#### Requirements

1. MSSQL Server `Azure SQL Database`, `Azure Synapse Analytics`, `Azure SQL Managed Instance`, `SQL Server 2019`, `SQL Server 2017`, `SQL Server 2016`, `SQL Server 2014`, `SQL Server 2012`, `PDW 2008R2 AU34`.
2. Create a dedicated read-only Airbyte user with access to all tables needed for replication
3. If you want to use CDC, please see [the relevant section below](mssql.md#change-data-capture-cdc) for further setup requirements

#### 1. Make sure your database is accessible from the machine running Airbyte

This is dependent on your networking setup. The easiest way to verify if Airbyte is able to connect to your MSSQL instance is via the check connection tool in the UI.

#### 2. Create a dedicated read-only user with access to the relevant tables \(Recommended but optional\)

This step is optional but highly recommended to allow for better permission control and auditing. Alternatively, you can use Airbyte with an existing user in your database.

_Coming soon: suggestions on how to create this user._

#### 3. Your database user should now be ready for use with Airbyte!

## Change Data Capture \(CDC\)

We use [SQL Server's change data capture feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017) to capture row-level `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations that occur on cdc-enabled tables.

Some extra setup requiring at least _db\_owner_ permissions on the database\(s\) you intend to sync from will be required \(detailed [below](mssql.md#setting-up-cdc-for-mssql)\).

Please read the [CDC docs](../../understanding-airbyte/cdc.md) for an overview of how Airbyte approaches CDC.

### Should I use CDC for MSSQL?

* If you need a record of deletions and can accept the limitations posted below, CDC is the way to go!
* If your data set is small and/or you just want a snapshot of your table in the destination, consider using Full Refresh replication for your table instead of CDC.
* If the limitations below prevent you from using CDC and your goal is to maintain a snapshot of your table in the destination, consider using non-CDC incremental and occasionally reset the data and re-sync.
* If your table has a primary key but doesn't have a reasonable cursor field for incremental syncing \(i.e. `updated_at`\), CDC allows you to sync your table incrementally.

### CDC Config

| Data to Sync             | Enum: `Existing and New`, `New Changes Only` | `Existing and New` | What data should be synced under the CDC. `Existing and New` will read existing data as a snapshot, and sync new changes through CDC. `New Changes Only` will skip the initial snapshot, and only sync new changes through CDC. See documentation [here](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/sqlserver.html#sqlserver-property-snapshot-mode) for details. Under the hood, this parameter sets the `snapshot.mode` in Debezium. |
| Snapshot Isolation Level |      Enum: `Snapshot`, `Read Committed`      |     `Snapshot`     | Mode to control which transaction isolation level is used and how long the connector locks tables that are designated for capture. If you don't know which one to choose, just use the default one. See documentation [here](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/sqlserver.html#sqlserver-property-snapshot-isolation-mode) for details. Under the hood, this parameter sets the `snapshot.isolation.mode` in Debezium.         |

#### CDC Limitations

* Make sure to read our [CDC docs](../../understanding-airbyte/cdc.md) to see limitations that impact all databases using CDC replication.
* There are some critical issues regarding certain datatypes. Please find detailed info in [this Github issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/4542).
* CDC is only available for SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 \(SP1\) and later.
* _db\_owner_ \(or higher\) permissions are required to perform the [neccessary setup](mssql.md#setting-up-cdc-for-mssql) for CDC.
* If you set `Initial Snapshot Isolation Level` to `Snapshot`, you must enable [snapshot isolation mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/snapshot-isolation-in-sql-server) on the database\(s\) you want to sync. This is used for retrieving an initial snapshot without locking tables.
* For SQL Server Always On read-only replica, only `Snapshot` initial snapshot isolation level is supported.
* On Linux, CDC is not supported on versions earlier than SQL Server 2017 CU18 \(SQL Server 2019 is supported\).
* Change data capture cannot be enabled on tables with a clustered columnstore index. \(It can be enabled on tables with a _non-clustered_ columnstore index\).
* The SQL Server CDC feature processes changes that occur in user-created tables only. You cannot enable CDC on the SQL Server master database.
* Using variables with partition switching on databases or tables with change data capture \(CDC\) is not supported for the `ALTER TABLE` ... `SWITCH TO` ... `PARTITION` ... statement
* Our implementation has not been tested with managed instances, such as Azure SQL Database \(we welcome any feedback from users who try this!\)
  * If you do want to try this, CDC can only be enabled on Azure SQL databases tiers above Standard 3 \(S3+\). Basic, S0, S1 and S2 tiers are not supported for CDC.
* Our CDC implementation uses at least once delivery for all change records.
* Read more on CDC limitations in the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017#limitations).

### Setting up CDC for MSSQL

#### 1. Enable CDC on database and tables

MS SQL Server provides some built-in stored procedures to enable CDC.

* To enable CDC, a SQL Server administrator with the necessary privileges \(_db\_owner_ or _sysadmin_\) must first run a query to enable CDC at the database level.

  ```text
  USE {database name}
  GO
  EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db
  GO
  ```

* The administrator must then enable CDC for each table that you want to capture. Here's an example:

  ```text
  USE {database name}
  GO

  EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table
  @source_schema = N'{schema name}',
  @source_name   = N'{table name}',
  @role_name     = N'{role name}',  [1]
  @filegroup_name = N'{fiilegroup name}', [2]
  @supports_net_changes = 0 [3]
  GO
  ```

  * \[1\] Specifies a role which will gain `SELECT` permission on the captured columns of the source table. We suggest putting a value here so you can use this role in the next step but you can also set the value of @role\_name to `NULL` to allow only _sysadmin_ and _db\_owner_ to have access. Be sure that the credentials used to connect to the source in Airbyte align with this role so that Airbyte can access the cdc tables.
  * \[2\] Specifies the filegroup where SQL Server places the change table. We recommend creating a separate filegroup for CDC but you can leave this parameter out to use the default filegroup.
  * \[3\] If 0, only the support functions to query for all changes are generated. If 1, the functions that are needed to query for net changes are also generated. If supports\_net\_changes is set to 1, index\_name must be specified, or the source table must have a defined primary key.

* \(For more details on parameters, see the [Microsoft doc page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-cdc-enable-table-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) for this stored procedure\).
* If you have many tables to enable CDC on and would like to avoid having to run this query one-by-one for every table, [this script](http://www.techbrothersit.com/2013/06/change-data-capture-cdc-sql-server_69.html) might help!

For further detail, see the [Microsoft docs on enabling and disabling CDC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/enable-and-disable-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15).

#### 2. Enable snapshot isolation

* When a sync runs for the first time using CDC, Airbyte performs an initial consistent snapshot of your database. To avoid acquiring table locks, Airbyte uses _snapshot isolation_, allowing simultaneous writes by other database clients. This must be enabled on the database like so:

  ```text
  ALTER DATABASE {database name}
    SET ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON;
  ```

#### 3. Create a user and grant appropriate permissions

* Rather than use _sysadmin_ or _db\_owner_ credentials, we recommend creating a new user with the relevant CDC access for use with Airbyte. First let's create the login and user and add to the [db\_datareader](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/database-level-roles?view=sql-server-ver15) role:

  ```text
  USE {database name};
  CREATE LOGIN {user name}
    WITH PASSWORD = '{password}';
  CREATE USER {user name} FOR LOGIN {user name};
  EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datareader', '{user name}';
  ```

  * Add the user to the role specified earlier when enabling cdc on the table\(s\):

    ```text
    EXEC sp_addrolemember '{role name}', '{user name}';
    ```

  * This should be enough access, but if you run into problems, try also directly granting the user `SELECT` access on the cdc schema:

    ```text
    USE {database name};
    GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA :: [cdc] TO {user name};
    ```

  * If feasible, granting this user 'VIEW SERVER STATE' permissions will allow Airbyte to check whether or not the [SQL Server Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15#relationship-with-log-reader-agent) is running. This is preferred as it ensures syncs will fail if the CDC tables are not being updated by the Agent in the source database.

    ```text
    USE master;
    GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO {user name};
    ```

#### 4. Extend the retention period of CDC data

* In SQL Server, by default, only three days of data are retained in the change tables. Unless you are running very frequent syncs, we suggest increasing this retention so that in case of a failure in sync or if the sync is paused, there is still some bandwidth to start from the last point in incremental sync.
* These settings can be changed using the stored procedure [sys.sp\_cdc\_change\_job](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-cdc-change-job-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) as below:

  ```text
  -- we recommend 14400 minutes (10 days) as retention period
  EXEC sp_cdc_change_job @job_type='cleanup', @retention = {minutes}
  ```

* After making this change, a restart of the cleanup job is required:

```text
  EXEC sys.sp_cdc_stop_job @job_type = 'cleanup';

  EXEC sys.sp_cdc_start_job @job_type = 'cleanup';
```

#### 5. Ensure the SQL Server Agent is running

* MSSQL uses the SQL Server Agent

  to [run the jobs necessary](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15#agent-jobs)

  for CDC. It is therefore vital that the Agent is operational in order for to CDC to work effectively. You can check

  the status of the SQL Server Agent as follows:

```text
  EXEC xp_servicecontrol 'QueryState', N'SQLServerAGENT';
```

* If you see something other than 'Running.' please follow

  the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/agent/start-stop-or-pause-the-sql-server-agent-service?view=sql-server-ver15)

  to start the service.

## Connection to MSSQL via an SSH Tunnel

Airbyte has the ability to connect to a MSSQL instance via an SSH Tunnel. The reason you might want to do this because it is not possible \(or against security policy\) to connect to the database directly \(e.g. it does not have a public IP address\).

When using an SSH tunnel, you are configuring Airbyte to connect to an intermediate server \(a.k.a. a bastion sever\) that _does_ have direct access to the database. Airbyte connects to the bastion and then asks the bastion to connect directly to the server.

Using this feature requires additional configuration, when creating the source. We will talk through what each piece of configuration means.

1. Configure all fields for the source as you normally would, except `SSH Tunnel Method`.
2. `SSH Tunnel Method` defaults to `No Tunnel` \(meaning a direct connection\). If you want to use an

   SSH Tunnel choose `SSH Key Authentication` or `Password Authentication`.

   1. Choose `Key Authentication` if you will be using an RSA private key as your secret for

      establishing the SSH Tunnel \(see below for more information on generating this key\).

   2. Choose `Password Authentication` if you will be using a password as your secret for establishing

      the SSH Tunnel.

3. `SSH Tunnel Jump Server Host` refers to the intermediate \(bastion\) server that Airbyte will connect to. This should

   be a hostname or an IP Address.

4. `SSH Connection Port` is the port on the bastion server with which to make the SSH connection. The default port for

   SSH connections is `22`, so unless you have explicitly changed something, go with the default.

5. `SSH Login Username` is the username that Airbyte should use when connection to the bastion server. This is NOT the

   MSSQL username.

6. If you are using `Password Authentication`, then `SSH Login Username` should be set to the

   password of the User from the previous step. If you are using `SSH Key Authentication` leave this

   blank. Again, this is not the MSSQL password, but the password for the OS-user that Airbyte is

   using to perform commands on the bastion.

7. If you are using `SSH Key Authentication`, then `SSH Private Key` should be set to the RSA

   private Key that you are using to create the SSH connection. This should be the full contents of

   the key file starting with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and ending

   with `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

### Generating an SSH Key Pair

The connector expects an RSA key in PEM format. To generate this key:

```text
ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM -f myuser_rsa
```

This produces the private key in pem format, and the public key remains in the standard format used by the `authorized_keys` file on your bastion host. The public key should be added to your bastion host to whichever user you want to use with Airbyte. The private key is provided via copy-and-paste to the Airbyte connector configuration screen, so it may log in to the bastion.

## Data type mapping

MSSQL data types are mapped to the following data types when synchronizing data. You can check the test values examples [here](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-mssql/src/test-integration/java/io/airbyte/integrations/source/mssql/MssqlSourceComprehensiveTest.java). If you can't find the data type you are looking for or have any problems feel free to add a new test!

## Upgrading from 0.4.17 and older versions to 0.4.18 and newer versions
There is a backwards incompatible spec change between Microsoft SQL Source connector versions 0.4.17 and 0.4.18. As part of that spec change
`replication_method` configuration parameter was changed to `object` from `string`.

In Microsoft SQL source connector versions 0.4.17 and older, `replication_method` configuration parameter was saved in the configuration database as follows:

```
"replication_method": "STANDARD"
```

Starting with version 0.4.18, `replication_method` configuration parameter is saved as follows:
```
"replication_method": {
    "method": "STANDARD"
}
```

After upgrading Microsoft SQL Source connector from 0.4.17 or older version to 0.4.18 or newer version you need to fix source configurations in the `actor` table
in Airbyte database. To do so, you need to run two SQL queries. Follow the instructions in [Airbyte documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/configuring-airbyte-db/#accessing-the-default-database-located-in-docker-airbyte-db) to
run SQL queries on Airbyte database.

If you have connections with Microsoft SQL Source using _Standard_ replication method, run this SQL:

```sql
update public.actor set configuration =jsonb_set(configuration, '{replication_method}', '{"method": "STANDARD"}', true)
WHERE actor_definition_id ='b5ea17b1-f170-46dc-bc31-cc744ca984c1' AND (configuration->>'replication_method' = 'STANDARD');
```

If you have connections with Microsoft SQL Source using _Logicai Replication (CDC)_ method,  run this SQL:

```sql
update public.actor set configuration =jsonb_set(configuration, '{replication_method}', '{"method": "CDC"}', true)
WHERE actor_definition_id ='b5ea17b1-f170-46dc-bc31-cc744ca984c1' AND (configuration->>'replication_method' = 'CDC');
