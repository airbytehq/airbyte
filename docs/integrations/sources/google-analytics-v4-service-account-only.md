# Google Analytics (Universal Analytics)

<HideInUI>

This page contains the setup guide and reference information for the Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) source connector.

This connector supports Universal Analytics properties through the [Reporting API v4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4).

</HideInUI>

:::caution

**The Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) connector will be deprecated soon.**

Google is phasing out Universal Analytics in favor of Google Analytics 4 (GA4). In consequence, we are deprecating the Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) connector and recommend that you migrate to the [Google Analytics 4 (GA4) connector](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/google-analytics-data-api) as soon as possible to ensure your syncs are not affected.

Due to this deprecation, we will not be accepting new contributions for this source.

For more information, see ["Universal Analytics is going away"](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528).

:::note

Google Analytics Universal Analytics (UA) connector, uses the older version of Google Analytics, which has been the standard for tracking website and app user behavior since 2012.

[Google Analytics 4 (GA4) connector](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/google-analytics-data-api) is the latest version of Google Analytics, which was introduced in 2020. It offers a new data model that emphasizes events and user properties, rather than pageviews and sessions. This new model allows for more flexible and customizable reporting, as well as more accurate measurement of user behavior across devices and platforms.

## Prerequisites

A Google Cloud account with [Viewer permissions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495) and [Google Analytics Reporting API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/analyticsreporting.googleapis.com/overview) and [Google Analytics API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/analytics.googleapis.com/overview) enabled.

## Setup guide

<!-- env:cloud -->

**For Airbyte Cloud:**

1. [Log into your Airbyte Cloud](https://cloud.airbyte.com/workspaces) account.
2. In the left navigation bar, click **Sources**. In the top-right corner, click **+ New source**.
3. On the Set up the source page, select **Google Analytics** from the **Source type** dropdown.
4. For Name, enter a name for the Google Analytics connector.
5. Authenticate your Google account via Service Account Key Authentication.
   - To authenticate your Google account via Service Account Key Authentication, enter your [Google Cloud service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) in JSON format. Make sure the Service Account has the Project Viewer permission.
6. Enter the **Replication Start Date** in YYYY-MM-DD format. The data added on and after this date will be replicated. If this field is blank, Airbyte will replicate all data.
7. Enter the [**View ID**](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/account-explorer/) for the Google Analytics View you want to fetch data from.
8. Leave **Data request time increment in days (Optional)** blank or set to 1. For faster syncs, set this value to more than 1 but that might result in the Google Analytics API returning [sampled data](#sampled-data-in-reports), potentially causing inaccuracies in the returned results. The maximum allowed value is 364.
<!-- /env:cloud -->

<!-- env:oss -->

**For Airbyte Open Source:**

1. Navigate to the Airbyte Open Source dashboard.
2. Go to the Airbyte UI and click **Sources** and then click **+ New source**.
3. On the Set up the source page, select **Google Analytics** from the **Source type** dropdown.
4. Enter a name for the Google Analytics connector.
5. Authenticate your Google account via Service Account Key Authentication:
   - To authenticate your Google account via Service Account Key Authentication, enter your [Google Cloud service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) in JSON format. Use the service account email address to [add a user](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009702) to the Google analytics view you want to access via the API and grant [Read and Analyze permissions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495).
5. Enter the **Replication Start Date** in YYYY-MM-DD format. The data added on and after this date will be replicated. If this field is blank, Airbyte will replicate all data.
<!-- /env:oss -->
6. Enter the [**View ID**](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/account-explorer/) for the Google Analytics View you want to fetch data from.
7. Optionally, enter a JSON object as a string in the **Custom Reports** field. For details, refer to [Requesting custom reports](#requesting-custom-reports)
8. Leave **Data request time increment in days (Optional)** blank or set to 1. For faster syncs, set this value to more than 1 but that might result in the Google Analytics API returning [sampled data](#sampled-data-in-reports), potentially causing inaccuracies in the returned results. The maximum allowed value is 364.

## Supported streams

The Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) source connector can sync the following tables:

| Stream name              | Schema                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Rate Limits and Performance Considerations \(Airbyte Open Source\)

[Analytics Reporting API v4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/limits-quotas)

- Number of requests per day per project: 50,000
- Number of requests per view (profile) per day: 10,000 (cannot be increased)
- Number of requests per 100 seconds per project: 2,000
- Number of requests per 100 seconds per user per project: 100 (can be increased in Google API Console to 1,000).

The Google Analytics connector should not run into the "requests per 100 seconds" limitation under normal usage. [Create an issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues) if you see any rate limit issues that are not automatically retried successfully and try increasing the `window_in_days` value.

## Sampled data in reports

If you are not on the Google Analytics 360 tier, the Google Analytics API may return sampled data if the amount of data in your Google Analytics account exceeds Google's [pre-determined compute thresholds](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192?hl=en&ref_topic=2601030&visit_id=637868645346124317-2833523666&rd=1#thresholds&zippy=%2Cin-this-article). This means the data returned in the report is an estimate which may have some inaccuracy. This [Google page](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192) provides a comprehensive overview of how Google applies sampling to your data.

In order to minimize the chances of sampling being applied to your data, Airbyte makes data requests to Google in one day increments (the smallest allowed date increment). This reduces the amount of data the Google API processes per request, thus minimizing the chances of sampling being applied. The downside of requesting data in one day increments is that it increases the time it takes to export your Google Analytics data. If sampling is not a concern, you can override this behavior by setting the optional `window_in_day` parameter to specify the number of days to look back and avoid sampling.
When sampling occurs, a warning is logged to the sync log.

## Requesting Custom Reports

Custom Reports allow for flexibility in the reporting dimensions and metrics to meet your specific use case. Use the [GA4 Query Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.google/ga4/query-explorer/) to help build your report. To ensure your dimensions and metrics are compatible, you can also refer to the [GA4 Dimensions & Metrics Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.google/ga4/dimensions-metrics-explorer/).

A custom report is formatted as: `[{"name": "<report-name>", "dimensions": ["<dimension-name>", ...], "metrics": ["<metric-name>", ...]}]`

Example of a custom report:
```json
[{
  "name" : "page_views_and_users",
  "dimensions" :[
    "ga:date",
    "ga:pagePath",
    "ga:sessionDefaultChannelGrouping"
  ],
  "metrics" :[
    "ga:screenPageViews",
    "ga:totalUsers"
  ]
}]
```
Multiple custom reports should be entered with a comma separator. Each custom report is created as it's own stream.
Example of multiple custom reports:
```json
[
  {
    "name" : "page_views_and_users",
    "dimensions" :[
      "ga:date",
      "ga:pagePath"
    ],
    "metrics" :[
      "ga:screenPageViews",
      "ga:totalUsers"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name" : "sessions_by_region",
    "dimensions" :[
      "ga:date",
      "ga:region"
    ],
    "metrics" :[
      "ga:totalUsers",
      "ga:sessions"
    ]
  }
]
```

Custom reports can also include segments and filters to pull a subset of your data. The report should be formatted as:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "<report-name>",
    "dimensions": ["<dimension-name>", ...],
    "metrics": ["<metric-name>", ...],
    "segments": ["<segment-id-or-dynamic-segment-name>", ...],
    "filter": "<filter-name>"
  }
]
```

* When using segments, make sure you also add the `ga:segment` dimension.

Example of a custom report with segments and/or filters:
```json
[{ "name" : "page_views_and_users",
	"dimensions" :[
		"ga:date",
		"ga:pagePath",
      "ga:segment"
   ],
   "metrics" :[
      "ga:sessions",
      "ga:totalUsers"
   ],
   "segments" :[
      "ga:sessionSource!=(direct)"
   ],
   "filter" :[
      "ga:sessionSource!=(direct);ga:sessionSource!=(not set)"
   ]
}]
```

To create a list of dimensions, you can use default Google Analytics dimensions (listed below) or custom dimensions if you have some defined. Each report can contain no more than 7 dimensions, and they must all be unique. The default Google Analytics dimensions are:

- `ga:browser`
- `ga:city`
- `ga:continent`
- `ga:country`
- `ga:date`
- `ga:deviceCategory`
- `ga:hostname`
- `ga:medium`
- `ga:metro`
- `ga:operatingSystem`
- `ga:pagePath`
- `ga:region`
- `ga:socialNetwork`
- `ga:source`
- `ga:subContinent`

To create a list of metrics, use a default Google Analytics metric (values from the list below) or custom metrics if you have defined them.
A custom report can contain no more than 10 unique metrics. The default available Google Analytics metrics are:

- `ga:14dayUsers`
- `ga:1dayUsers`
- `ga:28dayUsers`
- `ga:30dayUsers`
- `ga:7dayUsers`
- `ga:avgSessionDuration`
- `ga:avgTimeOnPage`
- `ga:bounceRate`
- `ga:entranceRate`
- `ga:entrances`
- `ga:exitRate`
- `ga:exits`
- `ga:newUsers`
- `ga:pageviews`
- `ga:pageviewsPerSession`
- `ga:sessions`
- `ga:sessionsPerUser`
- `ga:uniquePageviews`
- `ga:users`

Incremental sync is supported only if you add `ga:date` dimension to your custom report.

- Number of requests per 100 seconds per project: 2,000
- Number of requests per 100 seconds per user per project: 100 (can be increased in Google API Console to 1,000).

The Google Analytics connector should not run into the "requests per 100 seconds" limitation under normal usage. [Create an issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues) if you see any rate limit issues that are not automatically retried successfully and try increasing the `window_in_days` value.
