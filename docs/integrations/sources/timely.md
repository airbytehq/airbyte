# Timely

Timely can track time spent in every web and desktop app automatically for you. Get a precise daily record of all the time you spend in documents, meetings, emails, websites and video calls with zero effort.[Timely APIs](https://dev.timelyapp.com/).

Timely uses [Events](https://dev.timelyapp.com/#events) to store all the entries a user makes. Users can add, delete and edit all entries. Some userâ€™s actions are restricted based on their access level in Timely.

# Timely credentials

You should be able to create a Timely `Bearer Token` as described in [Intro to the Timely API](https://dev.timelyapp.com/#authorization)
