# Exact

Cloud business software for SMEs and their accountants.

## Overview

The sync uses the [Rest API](https://start.exactonline.nl/docs/HlpRestAPIResources.aspx?SourceAction=10). See also
the [Developer Reference](https://support.exactonline.com/community/s/knowledge-base#All-All-DNO-Content-gettingstarted).

## Supported Endpoints

Exact groups the available endpoints based on their respective service. This source supports the endpoints listed below.

## Features

| Feature           | Supported? |
|:------------------|:-----------|
| Full Refresh Sync | Yes        |
| Incremental       | Yes        |

### Incremental Sync

All endpoints support incremental sync. Regular endpoints use the `Modified` field. Sync endpoints use the `Timestamp`
field. Note, that this `Timestamp` represents a row version and is not related to a natural timestamp.

## Limitations

Extracting multiple divisions is not yet supported

## Authentication

Exact uses OAuth for authentication (including for the API). The API has strict rate limits:

- Access tokens can only be retrieved once every 10 minutes.
- Refresh tokens can only be used once.
    - Upon refresh, a new refresh token is returned which should be used in following refresh.
    - Refresh tokens expire after 30 days. This means, when sync doesn't run for more than 30 days, credentials have to
      be manually updated.

### Retrieving Credentials

1. First create a new app
2. Create initial OAuth token

Documentation can also be found
at [Exact Support](https://support.exactonline.com/community/s/knowledge-base#All-All-DNO-Content-oauth-eol-oauth-dev-impleovervw).

#### Create a new app

1. Login at [Exact App Center](https://apps.exactonline.com)
2. Click on `My Apps`
3. Click on `Register an App`
4. Fill in a `Name` of the app (e.g., Airbyte)
5. Fill in a `Redirect URI`, note this must be a valid URI as it's used in OAuth flow
6. Find your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` of the created app

#### Create initial OAuth refresh token

See documentation for this step
at [Exact Knowledge Base](https://support.exactonline.com/community/s/knowledge-base#All-All-DNO-Content-oauth-eol-oauth-devstep2)

1. In your browser go to the following URL (after replacing the variables).

   `https://start.exactonline.nl/api/oauth2/auth?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&redirect_uri=<REDIRECT_URI>&response_type=code`

2. Login with an account
3. Exact redirects to URL as `<REDIRECT_URI>?code=<CODE>`
4. Copy the `code` value
    1. Note, this value is likely URL encoded, it has to be decoded before making the following request (for instance
       using [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/#recipe=URL_Decode()))
5. Create initial token, for instance curl:

    ```
    curl -X POST 'https://start.exactonline.nl/api/oauth2/token' \
        --data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
        --data-urlencode 'client_id=<CLIENT_ID>' \
        --data-urlencode 'client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>' \
        --data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=<REDIRECT_URI>' \
        --data-urlencode 'code=<CODE>'
    ```

6. Response contains the `access_token` and `refresh_token`
7. Bonus: if `access_token` is expired following curl can be used to refresh the token

    ```
    curl -X POST 'https://start.exactonline.nl/api/oauth2/token' \
        --data-urlencode 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
        --data-urlencode 'refresh_token=<REFERSH_TOKEN>' \
        --data-urlencode 'client_id=<CLIENT_ID>' \
        --data-urlencode 'client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>' \
    ```
