## Supported sync modes

The Monday supports full refresh syncs

| Feature           | Supported? |
|:------------------|:-----------|
| Full Refresh Sync | Yes        |
| Incremental Sync  | Yes        |
| SSL connection    | No         |
| Namespaces        | No         |

## Supported Streams

Several output streams are available from this source:

* [Activity logs](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/activity-logs)
* [Items](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/items-queries)
* [Boards](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/groups-queries#groups-queries)
* [Teams](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/teams-queries)
* [Updates](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/updates-queries)
* [Users](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/users-queries-1)
* [Tags](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/tags-queries)
* [Workspaces](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/workspaces)

Important Notes:
* `Columns` are available from the `Boards` stream. By syncing the `Boards` stream you will get the `Columns` for each `Board` synced in the database
The typical name of the table depends on the `destination` you use like `boards.columns`, for instance.

* `Column Values` are  available from the `Items` stream. By syncing  the `Items` stream you will get the `Column Values` for each `Item` (row) of the board.
The typical name of the table depends on the `destination` you use like `items.column_values`, for instance.
If there are more endpoints you'd like Airbyte to support, please [create an issue.](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/new/choose)

* Incremental sync for `Items` and `Boards` streams is done using the `Activity logs` stream.
Ids of boards and items are extracted from activity logs events and used to selectively sync boards and items.
Some data may be lost if the time between incremental syncs is longer than the activity logs retention time for your plan.
Check your Monday plan at https://monday.com/pricing.


## Performance considerations

The Monday connector should not run into Monday API limitations under normal usage. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues) if you see any rate limit issues that are not automatically retried successfully.
