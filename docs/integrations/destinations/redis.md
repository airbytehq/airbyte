# Redis

## Sync overview

### Output schema

The incoming Airbyte data is structured depending on the target Redis cache/data type.
This connector maps an incoming data from a namespace and stream to a unique Redis key.

For the **_hash_** implementation as a Redis data type the keys and the hashes are structured in the following way:

**_key_**:

    namespace:stream:id

**_hash_**:

- `_airbyte_ab_id`: Sequential id for a given key generated by using the INCR Redis command.
- `_airbyte_emitted_at`: a timestamp representing when the event was received from the data source.
- `_airbyte_data`: a json text/object representing the data that was received from the data source.

### Features

| Feature                        | Support | Notes                                                                          |
| :----------------------------- | :-----: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full Refresh Sync              |   ✅    | Existing keys in the Redis cache are deleted and replaced with the new keys.   |
| Incremental - Append Sync      |   ✅    | New keys are inserted in the same keyspace without touching the existing keys. |
| Incremental - Append + Deduped |   ❌    |                                                                                |
| Namespaces                     |   ✅    | Namespaces will be used to determine the correct Redis key.                    |
| SSH Tunnel Connection          |   ✅    |                                                                                |
| SSL connection                 |   ✅    |                                                                                |

### Performance considerations

As long as you have the necessary memory capacity for your cache, Redis should be able to handle even millions of records without any issues since the data is stored in-memory with the option to
save snapshots periodically on disk.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- The connector is fully compatible with redis 2.8.x, 3.x.x and above
- Configuration
  - **_host_**: Hostname or address of the Redis server where to connect.
  - **_port_**: Port of the Redis server where to connect.
  - **_username_**: Username for authenticating with the Redis server.
  - **_password_**: Password for authenticating with the Redis server.
  - **_cache_type_**: Redis cache/data type to use when storing the incoming messages. i.e hash,set,list,stream,etc.
- SSL toggle the switch to connect using SSL
- For SSL Modes, select:
  - **disable** to disable encrypted communication between Airbyte and the source
  - **verify-full** to always require encryption and verify the identity of the source
