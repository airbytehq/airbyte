# Azure Blob Storage Migration Guide

## Upgrading to 1.0.0

### Airbyte field names

This version updates the Azure Blob Storage destination connector to use the [DV2 Airbyte metadata field names](../../understanding-airbyte/airbyte-metadata-fields). You should update any downstream consumers to reference the new field names. Specifically, these two fields have been renamed:

| Old field name        | New field name             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `_airbyte_ab_id`      | `_airbyte_raw_id`          |
| `_airbyte_emitted_at` | `_airbyte_extracted_at`    |

### Blob paths

The destination connector now includes the stream namespace in the blob path. For example, if you are syncing a stream `public.users`, the connector will now put blobs into `<container_name>/public/users/**` - previously it was putting blobs into `<container_name>/users/**`.

### File extensions

The option to create blobs without a file extension has been removed. We will now always be adding a file extension based on the chosen file format.

### Split files

The "Azure Blob Storage file spill size" option has been renamed to "file split size". It also now takes effect on CSV files, which previously ignored the option entirely.

### Required permissions

The connector no longer attempts to create Azure blob storage containers, and therefore you no longer need to provide the `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/write` permission.

### Block blobs

The connector now writes block blobs instead of append blobs. In older versions of the connector, there was no way to recognize when a blob was "ready" for consumption, because the connector would continuously append more data to blobs throughout a sync.

With block blobs, you may now assume that as soon as a blob appears in your blob container, that blob is fully-written, and can be safely consumed by your downstream processes.
