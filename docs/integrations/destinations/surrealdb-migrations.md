# SurrealDB Migration Guide

A migration guide is mainly migrating any Airbyte destination from Destinations V1 to V2.

As SurrealDB Destination has been built after the introduction of Airbyte Destinations V2, you don't need to read this documentation- your SurrealDB destination tables are always Destinations-V2-compliant.
