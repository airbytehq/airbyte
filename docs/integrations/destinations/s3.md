# S3

## Overview

This destination writes data to S3 bucket.

The Airbyte S3 destination allows you to sync data to AWS S3/ Minio S3. Each stream is written to its own directory under the bucket.

## Sync Mode

| Feature | Support | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Full Refresh Sync | ✅ | Warning: this mode deletes all previously synced data in the configured bucket path. |
| Incremental - Append Sync | ✅ | |
| Namespaces | ❌ | Setting a specific bucket path is equivalent to having separate namespaces. |

## Configuration

| Parameter | Type | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| S3 Endpoint | string | URL to S3, If using AWS S3 just leave blank. |
| S3 Bucket Name | string | Name of the bucket to sync data into. |
| S3 Bucket Path | string | Subdirectory under the above bucket to sync the data into. |
| S3 Region | string | See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) for all region codes. |
| Access Key ID | string | AWS/Minio credential. |
| Secret Access Key | string | AWS/Minio credential. |
| Format | object | Format specific configuration. See below for details. |

⚠️ Please note that under "Full Refresh Sync" mode, data in the configured bucket and path will be wiped out before each sync. We recommend you to provision a dedicated S3 resource for this sync to prevent unexpected data deletion from misconfiguration. ⚠️

The full path of the output data is:

```
<bucket-name>/<sorce-namespace-if-exists>/<stream-name>/<upload-date>-<upload-mills>-<partition-id>.<format-extension>
```

For example:

```
testing_bucket/data_output_path/public/users/2021_01_01_1609541171643_0.csv
↑              ↑                ↑      ↑     ↑          ↑             ↑ ↑
|              |                |      |     |          |             | format extension
|              |                |      |     |          |             partition id
|              |                |      |     |          upload time in millis
|              |                |      |     upload date in YYYY-MM-DD
|              |                |      stream name
|              |                source namespace (if it exists)
|              bucket path
bucket name
```

Please note that the stream name may contain a prefix, if it is configured on the connection.

The rationales behind this naming pattern are:
1. Each stream has its own directory.
2. The data output files can be sorted by upload time.
3. The upload time composes of a date part and millis part so that it is both readable and unique.

Currently, each data sync will only create one file per stream. In the future, the output file can be partitioned by size. Each partition is identifiable by the partition ID, which is always 0 for now.

## Output Schema

Each stream will be outputted to its dedicated directory according to the configuration. The complete datastore of each stream includes all the output files under that directory. You can think of the directory as equivalent of a Table in the database world.

- Under Full Refresh Sync mode, old output files will be purged before new files are created.
- Under Incremental - Append Sync mode, new output files will be added that only contain the new data.

### CSV

Each CSV file includes at least two Airbyte metadata columns. Depending on the `flattening` config, the data may reside in one column (`_airbyte_data`) when there is no flattening, or multiple columns with root level flattening.

| Column | Condition | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `_airbyte_ab_id` | Always exists | A uuid assigned by Airbyte to each processed record. |
| `_airbyte_emitted_at` | Always exists. | A timestamp representing when the event was pulled from the data source. |
| `_airbyte_data` | When no flattening is needed, all data reside under this column as a json blob. |
| root level fields| When root level flattening is selected, the root level fields are expanded. |

 For example, given the following json object from a source:

```json
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "name": {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Doe"
  }
}
```

With no flattening, the output CSV is:

| `_airbyte_ab_id` | `_airbyte_emitted_at` | `_airbyte_data` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `26d73cde-7eb1-4e1e-b7db-a4c03b4cf206` | 1622135805000 | `{ "user_id": 123, name: { "first": "John", "last": "Doe" } }` |

With root level flattening, the output CSV is:

| `_airbyte_ab_id` | `_airbyte_emitted_at` | `user_id` | `name` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `26d73cde-7eb1-4e1e-b7db-a4c03b4cf206` | 1622135805000 | 123 | `{ "first": "John", "last": "Doe" }` |

### Parquet

#### Configuration

The following configuration is available to configure the Parquet output:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `compression_codec` | enum | `UNCOMPRESSED` | **Compression algorithm**. Available candidates are: `UNCOMPRESSED`, `SNAPPY`, `GZIP`, `LZO`, `BROTLI`, `LZ4`, and `ZSTD`. |
| `block_size_mb` | integer | 128 (MB) | **Block size (row group size)** in MB. This is the size of a row group being buffered in memory. It limits the memory usage when writing. Larger values will improve the IO when reading, but consume more memory when writing. |
| `max_padding_size_mb` | integer | 8 (MB) | **Max padding size** in MB. This is the maximum size allowed as padding to align row groups. This is also the minimum size of a row group. |
| `page_size_kb` | integer | 1024 (KB) | **Page size** in KB. The page size is for compression. A block is composed of pages. A page is the smallest unit that must be read fully to access a single record. If this value is too small, the compression will deteriorate. |
| `dictionary_page_size_kb` | integer | 1024 (KB) | **Dictionary Page Size** in KB. There is one dictionary page per column per row group when dictionary encoding is used. The dictionary page size works like the page size but for dictionary. |
| `dictionary_encoding` | boolean | `true` | **Dictionary encoding**. This parameter controls whether dictionary encoding is turned on. |

These parameters are related to the `ParquetOutputFormat`. See the [Java doc](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.parquet/parquet-hadoop/1.12.0/org/apache/parquet/hadoop/ParquetOutputFormat.html) for more details. Also see [Parquet documentation](https://parquet.apache.org/documentation/latest/#configurations) for their recommended configurations (512 - 1024 MB block size, 8 KB page size).

#### Data schema

Under the hood, an Airbyte data stream in Json schema is first converted to Avro schema, and then written to Parquet format. Because the data stream can come from any data source, the Parquet S3 destination connector has the following arbitrary rules.

1. Json schema type is mapped to Avro / Parquet type as follows:

  | Json Data Type | Avro / Parquet Data Type |
  | :---: | :---: |
  | string | string |
  | number | double |
  | integer | int |
  | boolean | boolean |
  | null | null |
  | object | record |
  | array | array |

2. Built-in Json schema formats are not mapped to Avro logical types at this moment.
2. Json schema compositions ("allOf", "anyOf", and "oneOf") are not supported at this moment.
3. Only alphanumeric characters and underscores (`/a-zA-Z0-9_/`) are allowed in a stream or field name. Any special character will be converted to an alphabet or underscore. For example, `spécial:character_names` will become `special_character_names`. The original names will be stored in the `doc` property in this format: `_airbyte_original_name:<original-name>`.
4. All field will be nullable. For example, a `string` Json field will be typed as `["null", "string"]` in Parquet. This is necessary because the incoming data stream may have optional fields.
5. For array fields in Json schema, when the `items` property is an array, it means that each element in the array should follow its own schema sequentially. For example, the following specification means the first item in the array should be a string, and the second a number.

  ```json
  {
    "array_field": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": [
        { "type": "string" },
        { "type": "number" }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

  This is not supported in Avro schema. As a compromise, the converter creates a union, ["string", "number"], which is less stringent:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "array_field",
    "type": [
      "null",
      {
        "type": "array",
        "items": ["null", "string"]
      }
    ],
    "default": null
  }
  ```

6. Two Airbyte specific fields will be added to each Parquet record:

  | Field | Schema | Document |
  | :--- | :--- | :---: |
  | `_airbyte_ab_id` | `UUID` | [link](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#uuid)
  | `_airbyte_emitted_at` | `TimestampType (isAdjustedToUTC = true, unit = MILLIS)` | [link](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#instant-semantics-timestamps-normalized-to-utc) |

7. Currently `additionalProperties` is not supported. This means if the source is schemaless (e.g. Mongo), or has flexible fields, they will be ignored. We will have a solution soon. Feel free to submit a new issue if this is blocking for you.

For example, given the following Json schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "integer"
    },
    "user": {
      "type": ["null", "object"],
      "properties": {
        "id": {
          "type": "integer"
        },
        "field_with_spécial_character": {
          "type": "integer"
        }
      }
    },
    "created_at": {
      "type": ["null", "string"],
      "format": "date-time"
    }
  }
}
```

Its corresponding Avro / Parquet schema will be:

```json
{
  "name" : "stream_name",
  "type" : "record",
  "fields" : [ {
    "name" : "_airbyte_ab_id",
    "type" : {
      "type" : "string",
      "logicalType" : "uuid"
    }
  }, {
    "name" : "_airbyte_emitted_at",
    "type" : {
      "type" : "long",
      "logicalType" : "timestamp-millis"
    }
  }, {
    "name" : "id",
    "type" : [ "null", "int" ],
    "default" : null
  }, {
    "name" : "user",
    "type" : [ "null", {
      "type" : "record",
      "name" : "user",
      "fields" : [ {
        "name" : "id",
        "type" : [ "null", "int" ],
        "default" : null
      }, {
        "name" : "field_with_special_character",
        "type" : [ "null", "int" ],
        "doc" : "_airbyte_original_name:field_with_spécial_character",
        "default" : null
      } ]
    } ],
    "default" : null
  }, {
    "name" : "created_at",
    "type" : [ "null", "string" ],
    "default" : null
  } ]
}
```

## Getting started

### Requirements

1. Allow connections from Airbyte server to your AWS S3/ Minio S3 cluster \(if they exist in separate VPCs\).
2. An S3 bucket with credentials \(for the COPY strategy\).

### Setup guide

* Fill up S3 info
  * **S3 Endpoint**
    * Leave empty if using AWS S3, fill in S3 URL if using Minio S3.
  * **S3 Bucket Name**
    * See [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) to create an S3 bucket.
  * **S3 Bucket Region**
  * **Access Key Id**
    * See [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) on how to generate an access key.
    * We recommend creating an Airbyte-specific user. This user will require [read and write permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_s3_rw-bucket.html) to objects in the staging bucket.
  * **Secret Access Key**
    * Corresponding key to the above key id.
* Make sure your S3 bucket is accessible from the machine running Airbyte.
  * This depends on your networking setup.
  * You can check AWS S3 documentation with a tutorial on how to properly configure your S3's access [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-overview.html).
  * The easiest way to verify if Airbyte is able to connect to your S3 bucket is via the check connection tool in the UI.
