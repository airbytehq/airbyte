# BigQuery Migration Guide

## Upgrading to 2.0.0

This version introduces [Destinations V2](/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2/#what-is-destinations-v2), which provides better error handling, incremental delivery of data for large syncs, and improved final table structures. To review the breaking changes, and how to upgrade, see [here](/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2/#quick-start-to-upgrading). These changes will likely require updates to downstream dbt / SQL models, which we walk through [here](/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2/#updating-downstream-transformations).  Selecting `Upgrade` will upgrade **all** connections using this destination at their next sync. You can manually sync existing connections prior to the next scheduled sync to start the upgrade early. 

Worthy of specific mention, this version includes:

- Per-record error handling
- Clearer table structure
- Removal of sub-tables for nested properties
- Removal of SCD tables
