# MQTT

## Overview

The Airbyte MQTT destination allows you to sync data to any MQTT system compliance with version 3.1.X. Each stream is written to the corresponding MQTT topic.

## Prerequisites
- For Airbyte Open Source users using the [Postgres](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/postgres) source connector, [upgrade](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/upgrading-airbyte/) your Airbyte platform to version `v0.40.0-alpha` or newer and upgrade your MQTT connector to the latest version

### Sync overview

#### Output schema

Each stream will be output into a MQTT topic.

This connector writes data with JSON format (in bytes).

Each record will contain in its payload these 4 fields:

* `_airbyte_ab_id`: an uuid assigned by Airbyte to each event that is processed.
* `_airbyte_emitted_at`:  a timestamp representing when the event was pulled from the data source.
* `_airbyte_data`: a json blob representing with the event data.
* `_airbyte_stream`: the name of each record's stream.

#### Features

| Feature | Supported?\(Yes/No\) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Full Refresh Sync | No |  |
| Incremental - Append Sync | Yes |  |
| Incremental - Deduped History | No | As this connector does not support dbt, we don't support this sync mode on this destination. |
| Namespaces | Yes |  |

## Getting started

### Requirements

To use the MQTT destination, you'll need:

* A MQTT broker implementing MQTT protocol version 3.1.X.

### Setup guide

#### Network Access

Make sure your MQTT broker can be accessed by Airbyte.

#### **Permissions**

Airbyte should be allowed to write messages into topics. Based on the MQTT broker you have deployed, check if you'll need some specific permissions.

#### Target topics

You can determine the topics to which messages are written via the `topic_pattern` configuration parameter. Messages can be written to either a hardcoded, pre-defined topic, or dynamically written to different topics based on the [namespace](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/namespaces) or stream they came from.

To write all messages to a single hardcoded topic, enter its name in the `topic_pattern` field e.g: setting `topic_pattern` to `path1/path2/my-topic-name` will write all messages from all streams and namespaces to that topic.

To define the output topics dynamically, you can leverage the `{namespace}` and `{stream}` pattern variables, which cause messages to be written to different topics based on the values present when producing the records. For example, setting the `topic_pattern` parameter to `airbyte_syncs/{namespace}/{stream}` means that messages from namespace `n1` and stream `s1` will get written to the topic `airbyte_syncs/n1/s1`, and messages from `s2` to `airbyte_syncs/n1/s2` etc.

### Setup the MQTT destination in Airbyte

You should now have all the requirements needed to configure MQTT as a destination in the UI. You can configure the following parameters on the MQTT destination \(though many of these are optional or have default values\):

* **MQTT broker host**
* **MQTT broker port**
* **Use TLS**
* **Username**
* **Password**
* **Topic pattern**
* **Test topic**
* **Client ID**
* **Sync publisher**
* **Connect timeout**
* **Automatic reconnect**
* **Clean session**
* **Message retained**
* **Message QoS**

More info about this can be found in the [OASIS MQTT standard site](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/mqtt-v3.1.1.html).

_NOTE_: MQTT version 5 is not supported yet.
