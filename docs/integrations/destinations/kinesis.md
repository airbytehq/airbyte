# Kinesis

## Prerequisites

- For Airbyte Open Source users using the [Postgres](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/postgres) source connector, [upgrade](https://docs.airbyte.com/operator-guides/upgrading-airbyte/) your Airbyte platform to version `v0.40.0-alpha` or newer and upgrade your Kinesis connector to version `0.1.4` or newer

## Sync overview

### Output schema

The incoming Airbyte data is structured in a Json format and is sent across diferent stream shards determined by the partition key.
This connector maps an incoming data from a namespace and stream to a unique Kinesis stream. The Kinesis record which is sent to the stream is consisted of the following Json fields

- `_airbyte_ab_id`: Random UUID generated to be used as a partition key for sending data to different shards.
- `_airbyte_emitted_at`: a timestamp representing when the event was received from the data source.
- `_airbyte_data`: a json text/object representing the data that was received from the data source.

| :---------------------------- | :-----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full Refresh Sync             |   ❌    |                                                                                   |
| Incremental - Append Sync     |   ✅    | Incoming messages are streamed/appended to a Kinesis stream as they are received. |
| Incremental - Deduped History |   ❌    |                                                                                   |
| Namespaces                    |   ✅    | Namespaces will be used to determine the Kinesis stream name.                     |

### Performance considerations

Although Kinesis is designed to handle large amounts of real-time data by scaling streams with shards, you should be aware of the following Kinesis [Quotas and Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html).
The connector buffer size should also be tweaked according to your data size and freguency

## Getting started

### Requirements

- The connector is compatible with the latest Kinesis service version at the time of this writing.
- Configuration
  - **_Endpoint_**: Aws Kinesis endpoint to connect to. Default endpoint if not provided
  - **_Region_**: Aws Kinesis region to connect to. Default region if not provided.
  - **_shardCount_**: The number of shards with which the stream should be created. The amount of shards affects the throughput of your stream.
  - **_accessKey_**: Access key credential for authenticating with the service.
  - **_privateKey_**: Private key credential for authenticating with the service.
  - **_bufferSize_**: Buffer size used to increase throughput by sending data in a single request.
