# Oracle

## Overview

The Airbyte Oracle destination allows you to sync data to Oracle.

### Sync overview

#### Output schema

Each stream will be output into its own table in Oracle. Each table will contain 3 columns:

* `airbyte_ab_id`: a uuid assigned by Airbyte to each event that is processed. The column type in Oracle is `VARCHAR(64)`.
* `airbyte_emitted_at`: a timestamp representing when the event was pulled from the data source. The column type in Oracle is `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`.
* `airbyte_data`: a json blob representing with the event data. The column type in Oracles is `NCLOB`.

#### Features

| Feature | Supported?\(Yes/No\) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Full Refresh Sync | Yes |  |
| Incremental - Append Sync | Yes |  |
| Namespaces | Yes |  |

## Getting started

### Requirements

To use the Oracle destination, you'll need:

* An Oracle server version 11 or above

### Setup guide

#### Network Access

Make sure your Oracle database can be accessed by Airbyte. If your database is within a VPC, you may need to allow access from the IP you're using to expose Airbyte.

#### **Permissions**

As Airbyte namespaces allows us to store data into different schemas, we have different scenarios and list of required permissions:

| Login user | Destination user | Required permissions | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| DBA User | Any user | - | |
| Regular user | Same user as login | Create, drop and write table, create session | |
| Regular user | Any existing user | Create, drop and write ANY table, create session | Grants can be provided on a system level by DBA or by target user directly |
| Regular user | Not existing user | Create, drop and write ANY table, create user, create session | Grants should be provided on a system level by DBA | 

We highly recommend creating an Airbyte-specific user for this purpose.

### Setup the Oracle destination in Airbyte

You should now have all the requirements needed to configure Oracle as a destination in the UI. You'll need the following information to configure the Oracle destination:

* **Host**
* **Port**
* **Username**
* **Password**
* **Database**
