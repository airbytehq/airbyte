# DuckDB Migration Guide

## Upgrading to 0.3.0

This version updates the DuckDB libraries from `v0.8.1` to `v0.9.1`. Note that DuckDB `0.9.x` is not backwards compatible with prior versions of DuckDB. Please see the [DuckDB 0.9.0 release notes](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/tag/v0.9.0) for more information and for upgrade instructions.

MotherDuck users will need to log into the MotherDuck UI at https://app.motherduck.com/ and click "Start Upgrade". The upgrade prompt will automatically appear the next time the user logs in. If the prompt does not appear, then your database has been upgraded automatically, and in this case you are ready to to use the latest version of the connector.
