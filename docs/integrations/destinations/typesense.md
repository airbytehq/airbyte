# Typesense

## Overview

The Airbyte Typesense destination allows you to sync data to Airbyte.Typesense is a modern, privacy-friendly, open source search engine built from the ground up using cutting-edge search algorithms, that take advantage of the latest advances in hardware capabilities.

### Sync overview

Using overwrite sync, the [auto schema detection](https://typesense.org/docs/0.23.1/api/collections.html#with-auto-schema-detection) is used and all the fields in a document are automatically indexed for searching and filtering

With append mode, you have to create the collection first and can use [pre-defined schema](https://typesense.org/docs/0.23.1/api/collections.html#with-pre-defined-schema) that gives you fine-grained control over your document fields.

#### Output schema

Each stream will be output into its own collection in Typesense. If an id column is not provided, it will be generated.

### Requirements

To use the Typesense destination, you'll need an existing Typesense instance. You can learn about how to create one in the [Typesense docs](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html).

### Setup guide

The setup only requires two fields. First is the `host` which is the address at which Typesense can be reached. The second piece of information is the API key.
