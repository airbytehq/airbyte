# Databricks Lakehouse

## Overview

This destination syncs data to Delta Lake on Databricks Lakehouse. Each stream is written to its own
[delta-table](https://delta.io/).

:::caution
You **must** be using Unity Catalog to use this connector.
:::

:::info
Please note, at this time OAuth2 authentication is only supported in AWS
deployments. If you are running Databricks in GCP, you **must** use an access
token.
:::

This connector requires a JDBC driver to connect to the Databricks cluster. By using the driver and
the connector, you must agree to the
[JDBC ODBC driver license](https://databricks.com/jdbc-odbc-driver-license). This means that you can
only use this connector to connect third party applications to Apache Spark SQL within a Databricks
offering using the ODBC and/or JDBC protocols.

## Airbyte Setup

When setting up a Databricks destination, you need these pieces of information:

### Server Hostname / HTTP Path / Port

1. Open the workspace console.
2. Open your SQL warehouse:

   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/destination/databricks/databricks_open_sql_warehouse.png)

3. Open the Connection Details tab:

   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/destination/databricks/databricks_sql_warehouse_connection_details.png)

4. Finally, you'll need to provide the `Databricks Unity Catalog Path`, which is the path to the database you wish to use within the Unity Catalog. This is often the same as the workspace name.

### Authentication

#### OAuth (Recommended for AWS deployments of Databricks)

Follow the instructions in [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html)
to generate a client ID and secret.

#### Access Token (Recommended for Google Cloud deployments of Databricks)

1. Open your workspace console.
2. Click on your icon in the top-right corner, and head to `settings`, then `developer`, then `manage` under `access tokens`

   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/destination/databricks/dtabricks_token_user_new.png)

3. Enter a description for the token and how long it will be valid for (or leave blank for a permanent token):

   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/destination/databricks/databricks_generate_token.png)

### Other Options

- `Default Schema` - The schema that will contain your data. You can later override this on a per-connection basis.
- `Purge Staging Files and Tables` - Whether Airbyte should delete files after loading them into tables. Note: if deselected, Databricks will still delete your files after your retention period has passed (default - 7 days).

## Output Schema

Each table will have the following columns, in addition to your whatever columns were in your data:

| Column                   |   Type    | Notes                                                                  |
| :----------------------- | :-------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_airbyte_raw_id`        |  string   | A random UUID.                                                         |
| `_airbyte_extracted_at`  | timestamp | Timestamp when the source read the record.                             |
| `_airbyte_loaded_at`     | timestamp | Timestamp when the record was written to the destination               |
| `_airbyte_generation_id` |  bigint   | See the [refreshes](../../operator-guides/refreshes.md) documentation. |

Airbyte will also produce "raw tables" (by default in the `airbyte_internal` schema). We do not recommend directly interacting
with the raw tables, and their format is subject to change without notice.
