## Overview

This destination writes data to a directory on the _local_ filesystem on the host running Airbyte. By default, data is written to [/tmp/airbyte\_local](file:///tmp/airbyte_local/). To change this location, modify the `LOCAL_ROOT` environment variable for Airbyte.

### Sync Overview

#### Output schema

Each stream will be output into its own file. Each file will a collections of `json` objects containing 3 fields:

* `_airbyte_ab_id`: a uuid assigned by Airbyte to each event that is processed.
* `_airbyte_emitted_at`: a timestamp representing when the event was pulled from the data source.
* `_airbyte_data`: a json blob representing with the extracted data.
