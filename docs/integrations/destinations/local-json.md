# Local JSON

:::danger

This destination is meant to be used on a local workstation and won't work on Kubernetes

:::

## Overview

This destination writes data to a directory on the _local_ filesystem on the host running Airbyte. By default, data is written to `/tmp/airbyte_local`. To change this location, modify the `LOCAL_ROOT` environment variable for Airbyte.

### Sync Overview

#### Output schema

Each stream will be output into its own file. Each file will a collections of `json` objects containing 3 fields:

* `_airbyte_ab_id`: a uuid assigned by Airbyte to each event that is processed.
* `_airbyte_emitted_at`: a timestamp representing when the event was pulled from the data source.
* `_airbyte_data`: a json blob representing with the extracted data.

#### Features

| Feature | Supported |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Full Refresh Sync | Yes |  |
| Incremental - Append Sync | Yes |  |
| Incremental - Deduped History | No | As this connector does not support dbt, we don't support this sync mode on this destination. |
| Namespaces | No |  |

#### Performance considerations

This integration will be constrained by the speed at which your filesystem accepts writes.

## Getting Started

The `destination_path` will always start with `/local` whether it is specified by the user or not. Any directory nesting within local will be mapped onto the local mount.

By default, the `LOCAL_ROOT` env variable in the `.env` file is set `/tmp/airbyte_local`.

The local mount is mounted by Docker onto `LOCAL_ROOT`. This means the `/local` is substituted by `/tmp/airbyte_local` by default.

:::caution

Please make sure that Docker Desktop has access to `/tmp` (and `/private` on a MacOS, as /tmp has a symlink that points to /private. It will not work otherwise). You allow it with "File sharing" in `Settings -> Resources -> File sharing -> add the one or two above folder` and hit the "Apply & restart" button.

:::


### Example:

* If `destination_path` is set to `/local/cars/models`
* the local mount is using the `/tmp/airbyte_local` default
* then all data will be written to `/tmp/airbyte_local/cars/models` directory.

## Access Replicated Data Files

If your Airbyte instance is running on the same computer that you are navigating with, you can open your browser and enter [file:///tmp/airbyte\_local](file:///tmp/airbyte_local) to look at the replicated data locally. If the first approach fails or if your Airbyte instance is running on a remote server, follow the following steps to access the replicated files:

1. Access the scheduler container using `docker exec -it airbyte-server bash`
2. Navigate to the default local mount using `cd /tmp/airbyte_local`
3. Navigate to the replicated file directory you specified when you created the destination, using `cd /{destination_path}`
4. List files containing the replicated data using `ls`
5. Execute `cat {filename}` to display the data in a particular file

You can also copy the output file to your host machine, the following command will copy the file to the current working directory you are using:

```text
docker cp airbyte-server:/tmp/airbyte_local/{destination_path}/{filename}.jsonl .
```

Note: If you are running Airbyte on Windows with Docker backed by WSL2, you have to use similar step as above or refer to this [link](../../operator-guides/locating-files-local-destination.md) for an alternative approach.
