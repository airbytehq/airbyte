Note: the role controls what is visible and not to the connector. At a minimum the "SuiteAnalytics Connect" permission is required to connect to SuiteAnalytics over JDBC, as described in [Netsuite SuiteAnalytics documentations](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4102771016.html#To-set-up-SuiteAnalytics-Connect-permissions-using-Manage-Roles%3A)
