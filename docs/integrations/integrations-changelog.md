# Integrations Changelog

**You can request new integrations directly** [**here**](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Fintegration%2C+new-integration&template=new-integration-request.md&title=)**.** 

Note: Airbyte is not built on top of Singer, but is compatible with Singer's protocol. Airbyte's ambitions go beyond what Singer enables to do, so we are building our own protocol that will keep its compatibility with Singer's one.
