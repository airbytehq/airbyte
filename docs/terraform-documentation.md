# Terraform Documentation

Airbyte's Terraform provider enables you to automate & version-control your Airbyte configuration as code. Save time managing Airbyte and collaborate on Airbyte configuration changes with your teammates. Airbyte's Terraform provider is built off our [Airbyte API](https://api.airbyte.com).

The Terraform provider is available for users on Airbyte Cloud, OSS & Self-Managed Enterprise.

Check out our guide for [getting started with Airbyte's Terraform provider](https://reference.airbyte.com/reference/using-the-terraform-provider).

Additionally, you can find examples of data stacks using the Terraform provider in our [quickstarts repository](https://github.com/airbytehq/quickstarts).
