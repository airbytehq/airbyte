# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [conduct@airbyte.io](mailto:conduct@airbyte.io). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 1.4, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html)

## Slack Code of Conduct

Airbyte's Slack community is growing incredibly fast. We're home to over 1500 data professionals and are growing at an awesome pace. We are proud of our community, and have provided these guidelines to support new members in maintaining the wholesome spirit we have developed here. We appreciate your continued commitment to making this a community we are all excited to be a part of.

### Rule 1: Be respectful.

Our desire is for everyone to have a positive, fulfilling experience in Airbyte Slack, and we sincerely appreciate your help in making this happen.
All of the guidelines we provide below are important, but there’s a reason respect is the first rule. We take it seriously, and while the occasional breach of etiquette around Slack is forgivable, we cannot condone disrespectful behavior. 

### Rule 2: Use the most relevant channels.

We deliberately use topic-specific Slack channels so members of the community can opt-in on various types of conversations. Our members take care to post their messages in the most relevant channel, and you’ll often see reminders about the best place to post a message (respectfully written, of course!). If you're looking for help directly from the Community Assistance Team or other Airbyte employees, please stick to posting in the airbyte-help channel, so we know you're asking us specifically!

### Rule 3: Don’t double-post.

Please be considerate of our community members’ time. We know your question is important, but please keep in mind that Airbyte Slack is not a customer service platform but a community of volunteers who will help you as they are able around their own work schedule. You have access to all the history, so it’s easy to check if your question has already been asked. 

### Rule 4: Check question for clarity and thoughtfulness.

Airbyte Slack is a community of volunteers. Our members enjoy helping others; they are knowledgeable, gracious, and willing to give their time and expertise for free. Putting some effort into a well-researched and thoughtful post shows consideration for their time and will gain more responses.

### Rule 5: Keep it public.

This is a public forum; please do not contact individual members of this community without their express permission, regardless of whether you are trying to recruit someone, sell a product, or solicit help. 

### Rule 6: No soliciting!

The purpose of the Airbyte Slack community is to provide a forum for data practitioners to discuss their work and share their ideas and learnings. It is not intended as a place to generate leads for vendors or recruiters, and may not be used as such.

If you’re a vendor, you may advertise your product in #shameless-plugs. Advertising your product anywhere else is strictly against the rules. 

### Rule 7: Don't spam tags, or use @here or @channel.

Using the @here and @channel keywords in a post will not help, as they are disabled in Slack for everyone excluding admins. Nonetheless, if you use them we will remind you with a link to this rule, to help you better understand the way Airbyte Slack operates. 

Do not tag specific individuals for help on your questions. If someone chooses to respond to your question, they will do so. You will find that our community of volunteers is generally very responsive and amazingly helpful! 

### Rule 8: Use threads for discussion.

The simplest way to keep conversations on track in Slack is to use threads. The Airbyte Slack community relies heavily on threads, and if you break from this convention, rest assured one of our community members will respectfully inform you quickly! 

_If you see a message or receive a direct message that violates any of these rules, please contact an Airbyte team member and we will take the appropriate moderation action immediately. We have zero tolerance for intentional rule-breaking and hate speech._
