# Licenses

**Airbyte Connectors** and everything in our public repos excluding the airbytehq/airbyte-protocol are open sourced and available under the [Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)](https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license/faq) License. Each connector's `metadata.yaml` file contains more information.

**Airbyte Protocol** is open sourced and available under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).

**Airbyte Cloud & Airbyte Enterprise** are both closed source and require a commercial license from Airbyte.

## Questions and examples

- For questions regarding licenses, visit our [FAQ](license-faq.md) or [contact Airbyte](mailto:license@airbyte.io).

- For a list of examples supported by ELv2 and MIT to better understand whether you might be infringing on a license, check the [examples](examples.md).

## Short version

Unless you want to host Airbyte yourself and sell it as an ELT/ETL tool, or sell a product that directly exposes Airbyte’s UI or API, you should be good to go.
