# Examples

We chose ELv2 because it's permissive with what you can do with the software. To be as explicit as possible, here are examples of projects you can and can't do.

## Examples of projects that can't leverage the technology under ELv2 without a contract

- Hosting Airbyte yourself and selling it as an ELT/ETL tool. That means selling a competitive alternative to Airbyte Cloud or Airbyte Enterprise.

- Selling a product that directly exposes Airbyte’s UI or API.

## Examples of projects for which you can leverage Airbyte fully

- Creating an analytics or attribution platform for which you want to use Airbyte to bring data in on behalf of your customers.

- Creating any kind of platform on which you offer Airbyte's connectors to your customers to bring their data in, unless you're selling an ELT/ETL solution.

- Building your internal data stack and configuring pipelines through Airbyte's UI or API.
