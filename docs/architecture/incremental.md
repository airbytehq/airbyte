# Configuration: Streams & Incremental Syncs

## AirbyteStream
* The `AirbyteStream` has two sections:
    * The `discovered` section describes information and metadata about the data in the source. This section is generated by the source connector. Outside of the source, this section should be treated as read only.
    * The `configuration` section describes functionality that an end user would like applied on the sync. This section is configured by the end-user, and is never touched by the source.

## Discovered

Currently this section contains two fields: `json_schema` and `metadata`.
* `json_schema` describes the structure of the data in a source.
* `metadata` describes other information about the data in the source. For example what features are supported for the stream.

## Configuration
* This section currently has two fields: `sync_mode` and `comparable`.
* `sync_mode` which describes how the data will be synced (e.g. `full_refresh` or `incremental`).
* `comparable` which is the path to the field that will be used to determine if a record is new or modified since the last sync. This field is REQUIRED if `sync_mode` is `incremental`. Otherwise it is ignored.
