# Configuring Airbyte

This section covers how to configure Airbyte, and the various configuration Airbyte accepts.

Configuration is currently via environment variables. See the below section on how to modify these variables.

## Docker Deployments

The recommended way to run an Airbyte Docker deployment is via the Airbyte repo's `docker-compose.yaml` and `.env` file.

To configure the default Airbyte Docker deployment, modify the bundled `.env` file. The `docker-compose.yaml` file injects appropriate variables into
the containers.

If you want to manage your own docker files, please refer to Airbyte's docker file to ensure applications get the correct variables.

## Kubernetes Deployments

The recommended way to run an Airbyte Kubernetes deployment is via the `Kustomize` overlays.

We recommend using the overlays in the `stable` directory as these have preset resource limits.

To configure the default Airbyte Kubernetes deployment, modify the `.env` in the respective directory. Each application will consume the appropriate
env var from a generated configmap.

If you want to manage your own Kube manifests, please refer to the various `Kustomize` overlays for examples.

## Reference

The following are the possible configuration options organised by deployment type and services.

Internal-only variables have been omitted for clarity. See `Configs.java` for a full list.

Be careful using variables marked as `alpha` as they aren't meant for public consumption.

### Shared

The following variables are relevant to both Docker and Kubernetes.

#### Core

1. `AIRBYTE_VERSION` - Defines the Airbyte deployment version.
2. `SPEC_CACHE_BUCKET` - Defines the bucket for caching specs. This immensely speeds up spec operations. This is updated when new versions are published.
3. `WORKER_ENVIRONMENT` - Defines if the deployment is Docker or Kubernetes. Airbyte behaves accordingly.
4. `CONFIG_ROOT` - Defines the configs directory. Applies only to Docker, and is present in Kubernetes for backward compatibility.
5. `WORKSPACE_ROOT` - Defines the Airbyte workspace directory. Applies only to Docker, and is present in Kubernetes for backward compatibility.

#### Access

Set to empty values, e.g. "" to disable basic auth. **Be sure to change these values**.

1. BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=airbyte
2. BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=password
3. BASIC_AUTH_PROXY_TIMEOUT=600 - Defines the proxy timeout time for requests to Airbyte Server. Main use should be for dynamic discover when creating a connection (S3, JDBC, etc) that takes a long time.
