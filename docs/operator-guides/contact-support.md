## Airbyte Cloud Support

If you have questions about connector setup, error resolution, or want to report a bug, Airbyte Support is available to assist you. We recommend checking [our documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/) and searching our [Help Center](https://support.airbyte.com/hc/en-us) before opening a support ticket.

If you couldn't find the information you need in our docs or Help Center, open a ticket within the Airbyte Cloud platform by selecting the "Support" icon in the lower left navigation bar. Alternatively, you can submit a ticket through our [Help Center](https://support.airbyte.com/hc/en-us) by completing an Airbyte Cloud Support Request. Our team is online and availible to assist from 7AM - 7PM Eastern.  

**If you're unsure about the supported connectors, refer to our [Connector Support Levels](https://docs.airbyte.com/project-overview/product-support-levels/) & [Connector Catalog](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/).**

For account or credit-related inquiries, contact our [sales team](https://airbyte.com/talk-to-sales).

If you don't see a connector you need, you can submit a [connector request](https://airbyte.com/connector-requests).

To stay updated on Airbyte's future plans, take a look at [our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/airbytehq/projects/37/views/1).

Please be sure to sign up for Airbyte with your company email address, as we do not support personal accounts.  

## Airbyte Enterprise (self-hosted) Support

If you're running Airbyte Open Source with Airbyte Enterprise or have an OSS support package, we're here to help you with upgrading Airbyte versions, debugging connector issues, or troubleshooting schema changes.

Before opening a support ticket, we recommend consulting [our documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/) and searching our [Help Center](https://support.airbyte.com/hc/en-us). If your question remains unanswered, please submit a ticket through our Help Center. We suggest creating an [Airbyte Help Center account](https://airbyte1416.zendesk.com/auth/v2/login/signin?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.airbyte.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us&theme=hc&locale=en-us&brand_id=15365055240347&auth_origin=15365055240347%2Ctrue%2Ctrue) to access your organization's support requests. Our team is online and availible to assist from 7AM - 7PM Eastern.

**Connector support is based on certification status of the connector.** Please see our [Connector Support Levels](https://docs.airbyte.com/project-overview/product-support-levels) if you have any questions on support provided for one of your connectors. 

Submitting a Pull Request for review?

Although we strive to offer our utmost assistance, there are certain requests that we are unable to support. Currently, we do not provide assistance for these particular items:
