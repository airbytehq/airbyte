# Airbyte Support

Hold up! Have you looked at [our docs](https://docs.airbyte.com/) yet? We recommend searching the wealth of knowledge in our documentation as many times the answer you are looking for is there!

We also hold daily office hours, Monday to Friday, where you can engage in live discussions with the community and Airbyte team. Join the **#office-hours** channel to participate and view the schedule.

If you require personalized support, reach out to our sales team to inquire about [Airbyte Enterprise](https://airbyte.com/airbyte-enterprise).

## Airbyte Cloud Support

If you have questions about connector setup, error resolution, or want to report a bug, Airbyte Support is available to assist you. We recommend checking [our documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/) and searching our [Help Center](https://support.airbyte.com/hc/en-us) before opening a support ticket.

If you couldn't find the information you need in our docs or Help Center, open a ticket within the Airbyte Cloud platform by selecting the "Support" icon in the lower left navigation bar. Alternatively, you can submit a ticket through our [Help Center](https://support.airbyte.com/hc/en-us) by completing an Airbyte Cloud Support Request.

If you're unsure about the supported connectors, refer to our [connector catalog](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/) & [release phases](https://docs.airbyte.com/project-overview/product-release-stages/).

For account or credit-related inquiries, contact our [sales team](https://airbyte.com/talk-to-sales).

If you don't see a connector you need, you can submit a [connector request](https://airbyte.com/connector-requests).

To stay updated on Airbyte's future plans, take a look at [our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/airbytehq/projects/37/views/1).

## Airbyte Enterprise (self-hosted) Support

If you're running Airbyte Open Source with Airbyte Enterprise or have an OSS support package, we're here to help you with upgrading Airbyte versions, debugging connector issues, or troubleshooting schema changes.

Before opening a support ticket, we recommend consulting [our documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/) and searching our [Help Center](https://support.airbyte.com/hc/en-us). If your question remains unanswered, please submit a ticket through our Help Center. We suggest creating an [Airbyte Help Center account](https://airbyte1416.zendesk.com/auth/v2/login/signin?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.airbyte.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us&theme=hc&locale=en-us&brand_id=15365055240347&auth_origin=15365055240347%2Ctrue%2Ctrue) to access your organization's support requests.

Submitting a Pull Request for review?
