# Local Deployment

{% hint style="info" %}
These instructions have been tested on MacOS, Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04.
{% endhint %}

## Setup & launch Airbyte

* Install Docker on your workstation \(see [instructions](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)\). Make sure you're on the latest version of `docker-compose`.
* After Docker is installed, you can immediately get started locally by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git
cd airbyte
docker-compose up
```

* In your browser, just visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
* Start moving some data!

## Deploy on Windows

We recommend following [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) to install Docker on Windows. After installing the WSL 2 backend and Docker you should be able to run containers using Windows PowerShell. Additionally, as we note frequently, you will need `docker-compose` to build Airbyte from source. The suggested guide already installs `docker-compose` on Windows.

## Troubleshooting

**I have a Mac with the M1 chip. Is it possible to run Airbyte?**

Some users using Macs with an M1 chip are facing some problems running Airbyte. The problem is related with the chip and Docker. [Issue \#2017](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/2017) was created to follow up the problem, you can subscribe to it and get updates about the resolution. If you can successfully run Airbyte using a MacBook with the M1 chip, let us know so that we can share the process with the community!
