## Setup & launch Airbyte

* Install Docker on your workstation \(see [instructions](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)\). Note: There is a known issue with docker-compose 1.27.3. If you are using that version, please upgrade to 1.27.4.
* After Docker is installed, you can immediately get started locally by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git
cd airbyte
docker-compose up
```

* In your browser, just visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
* Start moving some data!

## Deploy on Windows

We recommend following [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) to install Docker on Windows. After installing the WSL 2 backend and Docker you should be able to run containers using Windows PowerShell. Additionally, as we note frequently, you will need `docker-compose` to build Airbyte from source. The suggested guide already installs `docker-compose` on Windows. 

Instead of cloning the repo, you can alternatively download the latest Airbyte release [here](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/releases). Unzip the downloaded file, access the unzipped file using PowerShell terminal, and run `docker-compose up`. After this, you should see the Airbyte containers in the Docker application as in the image below.
