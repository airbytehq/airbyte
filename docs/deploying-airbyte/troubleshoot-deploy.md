# Troubleshooting abctl

In this page you're going to find common errors users reported trying to use `abctl`.

## Errors

### `pod airbyte-abctl-airbyte-bootloader failed`

The `airbyte-bootloader` is the first to start during the installation.
Version `>0.15.0` of `abctl` prints the service logs to make simpler to understand what is causing the issue.
You're facing this problem feel free to jump into the [discussion](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/discussions/45458) to get help.

### `unable to create kind cluster: command "docker run --name airbyte-abctl-control-plane ..." failed with error: exit status 126`

Nothing here yet.

### `failed to init node with kubeadm`

```shell
 unable to create kind cluster: failed to init node with kubeadm: 
 command "docker exec --privileged airbyte-abctl-control-plane kubeadm init
  --skip-phases=preflight --config=/kind/kubeadm.conf --skip-token-print --v=6" 
  failed with error: exit status 1
 ```

### `timed out waiting for the condition`

```shell
unable to install airbyte chart: unable to install helm: failed pre-install:
 1 error occurred: * timed out waiting for the condition
```

### `must be a DNS name, not an IP address`

```shell
unable to create ingress: Ingress.networking.k8s.io "ingress-abctl" is invalid: 
spec.rules[2].host: Invalid value: "0.0.0.0": must be a DNS name, not an IP address
```

### `unable to read values from yaml file`

Check if you're in the right directory or informing the path to the file correctly.

```shell
unable to merge values with values file './values.yaml': unable to read values 
from yaml file './values.yaml': failed to read file ./values.yaml: open ./values.yaml:
 no such file or directory
```

### `could not create rest config`

```shell
unable to initialize local command: error communicating with kubernetes: 
could not create rest config: stat /root/.airbyte/abctl/abctl.kubeconfig: 
no such file or directory
```

### `failed to create patch: The order in patch list`

This error happens sometimes when user had installed `abctl local install` and after run `abctl local install --low-resource-mode`.
The team is [working on a fix](https://github.com/airbytehq/abctl/pull/114)

```shell
unable to install airbyte chart: unable to install helm: failed to create patch: 
The order in patch list: [map[name:JOB_MAIN_CONTAINER_CPU_REQUEST value:0] 
map[name:JOB_MAIN_CONTAINER_CPU_REQUEST valueFrom:map[configMapKeyRef:
map[key:JOB_MAIN_CONTAINER_CPU_REQUEST name:airbyte-abctl-airbyte-env]]]
 map[name:JOB_MAIN_CONTAINER_CPU_LIMIT value:0] map[name:JOB_MAIN_CONTAINER_CPU_LIMIT 
 valueFrom:map[configMapKeyRef:map[key:JOB_MAIN_CONTAINER_CPU_LIMIT 
 name:airbyte-abctl-airbyte-env]]] map[name:JOB_MAIN_CONTAINER_MEMORY_REQUEST 
 value:0] map[name:JOB_MAIN_CONTAINER_MEMORY_REQUEST 
 ```

### `connection refused`

```shell
nable to initialize local command: error communicating with kubernetes:
 unable to fetch kubernetes server version: Get "https://127.0.0.1:50124/version":
  dial tcp 127.0.0.1:[PORT]: connect: connection refused
```

## FAQ

### Using standard tools to interact with an Airbyte instance that was installed with `abctl`

`abctl` install Airbyte into a kind cluster on your local machine. If you'd like to interact directly with any of the underlying infrastructure, you can use standard tooling. You will need to make sure these tools are installed (or install them yourself). Any of these out of the box tools will work with an Airbyte instance installed with `abctl`.

If you want to interact with the pods or resources inside the cluster you can use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) and [helm](https://helm.sh/). Just make sure you are pointing at the correct K8s configuration e.g. `kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.airbyte/abctl/abctl.kubeconfig --namespace airbyte-abctl get pods`

[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is a tool for creating a K8s cluster using docker instead of having to install a local K8s cluster. You only need to think about kind if you want to make an adjustment to the cluster itself.

For more advanced interactions (e.g. loading custom docker containers), read more in [developing locally](../../contributing-to-airbyte/developing-locally#using-abctl-for-airbyte-development).

### Unable To Locate User Email

:::note
In `abctl` [v0.11.0](https://github.com/airbytehq/abctl/releases/tag/v0.11.0), support for basic-auth was removed (as basic-auth support was removed from the `Airbyte Platform` in [v0.63.11](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-platform/releases/tag/v0.63.11), and replaced with a more secure randomly generated password.  When logging into Airbyte, the email (provided during registration) should be automatically populated. Both the email and the randomly generated password can be fetched by running `abctl local credentials`.

Airbyte is aware of situations where the email is not be automatically populated and we are working on addressing this within the `abctl` tool.  In the interim, some manually steps are required to retrieve the authentication email address when it is unknown.
:::

If the email address for authenticating is not automatically populated, you can set an email with the following command:
```
abctl local credentials --email <USER@COMPANY.EXAMPLE>
```

The password for this user can be retrieved by running `abctl local credentials`.

### Using Custom Connectors

In order to run a custom connector with an Airbyte instance that is running in kind, you must load the docker image of that connector into the cluster. A connector container can be loaded using the following command:
```
kind load docker-image <image-name>:<image-tag> -n airbyte-abctl
```
