# Deploy Airbyte

### Official Deployment Method

There are three official methods to deploy Airbyte:

- Kubernetes using Helm
- `abctl` tool
- and runing the `run-ab-platform.sh` on local setups

We strongly recommend to you use Kubernetes for production deployments as it gives you full control
to configure the deployment and use `abctl` and `run-ab-platform.sh` for development.

### Community

Besides the official deployment you can choose some community guides to deploy in other platform.

- Restack
- Plural
- ...
