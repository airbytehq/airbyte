# Deploy Airbyte on Kubernetes using Helm

## Overview

Airbyte allows scaling sync workloads horizontally using Kubernetes. The core components \(api server, worker, etc\) run as deployments while the scheduler launches connector-related pods on different nodes.

## Quickstart

If you don't want to configure your own Kubernetes cluster and Airbyte instance, you can use the free, open-source project [Plural](https://www.plural.sh/) to bring up a Kubernetes cluster and Airbyte for you. Use [this guide](on-plural.md) to get started.

Alternatively, you can deploy Airbyte on [Restack](https://www.restack.io) to provision your Kubernetes cluster on AWS. Follow [this guide](on-restack.md) to get started.

:::note
Airbyte running on Self-Hosted Kubernetes doesn't support DBT Transformations. Please refer to [#5901](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/5091)
:::

:::note
Airbyte Kubernetes Community Edition does not support basic auth by default.
To enable basic auth, consider adding a reverse proxy in front of Airbyte.

## Getting Started

### Cluster Setup

For local testing we recommend following one of the following setup guides:

- [Docker Desktop \(Mac\)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start)
  - NOTE: Start Minikube with at least 4gb RAM with `minikube start --memory=4000`
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

For testing on GKE you can [create a cluster with the command line or the Cloud Console UI](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-zonal-cluster).

For testing on EKS you can [install eksctl](https://eksctl.io/introduction/) and run `eksctl create cluster` to create an EKS cluster/VPC/subnets/etc. This process should take 10-15 minutes.

For production, Airbyte should function on most clusters v1.19 and above. We have tested support on GKE and EKS. If you run into a problem starting Airbyte, please reach out on the `#troubleshooting` channel on our [Slack](https://slack.airbyte.io/) or [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fbug&template=bug-report.md&title=).

### Install `kubectl`

If you do not already have the CLI tool `kubectl` installed, please follow [these instructions to install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

### Configure `kubectl`

Configure `kubectl` to connect to your cluster by using `kubectl use-context my-cluster-name`.

For GKE:

1. Configure `gcloud` with `gcloud auth login`.
2. On the Google Cloud Console, the cluster page will have a `Connect` button, which will give a command to run locally that looks like

   `gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME --zone $ZONE_NAME --project $PROJECT_NAME`.

3. Use `kubectl config get-contexts` to show the contexts available.
4. Run `kubectl config use-context $GKE_CONTEXT` to access the cluster from `kubectl`.

For EKS:

1. [Configure your AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) to connect to your project.
2. Install [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/introduction/)
3. Run `eksctl utils write-kubeconfig --cluster=<CLUSTER NAME>` to make the context available to `kubectl`
4. Use `kubectl config get-contexts` to show the contexts available.
5. Run `kubectl config use-context <eks context>` to access the cluster with `kubectl`.

### Install helm

To install helm simply run:

For MacOS:

`brew install helm`

For Linux:

1. Download installer script `curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3`
2. Assign required premissions `chmod 700 get_helm.sh`
3. Run script `./get_helm.sh`

### Add Helm Repository

From now charts are stored in helm-repo thus there're no need to clone the repo each time you need to deploy the chart.

To add remote helm repo simply run: `helm repo add airbyte https://airbytehq.github.io/helm-charts`.

Where `airbyte` is the name of the repository that will be indexed locally.

After adding the repo, perform the repo indexing process by running `helm repo update`.

After this you can browse all charts uploaded to repository by running `helm search repo airbyte`

It'll produce output similar to below:

```text
NAME                            	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
airbyte/airbyte                 	0.49.9       	0.50.33    	Helm chart to deploy airbyte

airbyte/worker                  	0.49.9       	0.50.33    	Helm chart to deploy airbyte-worker
```

## Deploy Airbyte

### Default deployment

If you don't intend to customise your deployment, you can deploy airbyte as is with default values.

In order to do so, run the command:

```
helm install %release_name% airbyte/airbyte
```

**Note**: `release_name` should only contain lowercase letters and optionally dashes (`release_name` must start with a letter).

### Custom deployment

In order to customize your deployment, you need to create `values.yaml` file in the local folder and populate it with default configuration override values.

`values.yaml` example can be located in [charts/airbyte](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-platform/blob/main/charts/airbyte/values.yaml) folder of the Airbyte repository.

After specifying your own configuration, run the following command:

```text
helm install --values path/to/values.yaml %release_name% airbyte/airbyte
```

## Migrate from old charts to new ones

Starting from `0.39.37-alpha` we've revisited helm charts structure and separated all components of airbyte into their own independent charts, thus by allowing our developers to test single component without deploying airbyte as a whole and by upgrading single component at a time.

In most cases upgrade from older monolith chart to a new one should go without any issue, but if you've configured custom logging or specified custom configuration of DB or Logging then follow the instructions listed below

### Minio migration

Since the latest release of bitnami/minio chart, they've changed the way of setting up the credentials for accessing the minio. (written mid-2022)

Going forward in new version you need to specify the following values in values yaml for user/password instead old one

Before:

```text
minio:
  rootUser: airbyte-user
  rootPassword: airbyte-password-123
```

After:

```text
minio:
  auth:
    rootUser: minio
    rootPassword: minio123

```

Before upgrading the chart update values.yaml as stated above and then run:

- Get the old rootPassword by running `export ROOT_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace "default" %release_name%-minio -o jsonpath="{.data.root-password}" | base64 -d)`
- Perform upgrade of chart by running `helm upgrade %release_name% airbyte/airbyte --set auth.rootPassword=$ROOT_PASSWORD`
  - If you get an error about setting the auth.rootPassword, then you forgot to update the `values.yaml` file

### External Logs with S3

::info
S3 logging was tested on [Airbyte Helm Chart Version 0.50.13](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/airbyte/airbyte/0.50.13)
:::

Create a file called `airbyte-logs-secrets.yaml` to store the AWS Keys and other informations:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: airbyte-logs-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  AWS_KEY: <AWS_KEY>
  AWS_SECRET_KEY: <AWS_SECRET_KEY>
  S3_LOG_BUCKET: <BUCKET_NAME>
  S3_LOG_BUCKET_REGION: <REGION>
```
Run `kubectl apply -f airbyte-logs-secrets.yaml -n <NAMESPACE>` to create the secret in the namespace you're using Airbyte.
This file contains more than just the keys but it needs for now. Future updates will make the configuration easier.

Change the global section to use `S3` external logs.
```yaml
global:
  # <...>
  state:
    # -- Determines which state storage will be utilized; "MINIO", "S3", or "GCS"
    storage:
      type: "S3"
  # <...>
  logs:
    accessKey:
      password: ""
      existingSecret: "airbyte-logs-secrets"
      existingSecretKey: "AWS_KEY"
    secretKey:
      password: ""
      existingSecret: "airbyte-logs-secrets"
      existingSecretKey: "AWS_SECRET_KEY"
  # <...>
  storage:
      type: "S3"

  minio:
    # Change from true to false
    enabled: false
    nodeSelector: {}
    tolerations: []
    affinity: {}
```
GCS Logging information is below but you can try to use `External Minio` as well but it was not tested yet. Feel free to run tests and update the documentation.

Add extra env variables to the following blocks:
```yaml
worker:
  extraEnv:
    - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: airbyte-logs-secrets
          key: AWS_KEY
    - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: airbyte-logs-secrets
          key: AWS_SECRET_KEY
    - name: STATE_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: airbyte-logs-secrets
          key: AWS_KEY
    - name: STATE_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: airbyte-logs-secrets
          key: AWS_SECRET_KEY
    - name: STATE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: airbyte-logs-secrets
          key: S3_LOG_BUCKET
    - name: STATE_STORAGE_S3_REGION
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: airbyte-logs-secrets
          key: S3_LOG_BUCKET_REGION
```

and also edit the server block:

```yaml
server:
  extraEnv:
    - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: airbyte-logs-secrets
          key: AWS_KEY
    - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: airbyte-logs-secrets
          key: AWS_SECRET_KEY
    - name: STATE_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: airbyte-logs-secrets
          key: AWS_KEY
    - name: STATE_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: airbyte-logs-secrets
          key: AWS_SECRET_KEY
    - name: STATE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: airbyte-logs-secrets
          key: S3_LOG_BUCKET
    - name: STATE_STORAGE_S3_REGION
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: airbyte-logs-secrets
          key: S3_LOG_BUCKET_REGION
```

Than run:
`helm upgrade --install %RELEASE_NAME% airbyte/airbyte -n <NAMESPACE> --values /path/to/values.yaml --version 0.50.13`

### External Logs with GCS


:::Info
GCS Logging is similar to the approach taken for S3 above, with a few small differences
GCS logging was tested on [Airbyte Helm Chart Version 0.53.178](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/airbyte/airbyte/0.53.178)
:::

#### Create Google Cloud Storage Bucket

1. **Access Google Cloud Console**: Go to the Google Cloud Console and select or create a project where you want to create the bucket.
2. **Open Cloud Storage**: Navigate to "Storage" > "Browser" in the left-side menu.
3. **Create Bucket**: Click on "Create bucket". Give your bucket a unique name, select a region for the bucket, and configure other settings such as storage class and access control according to your requirements. Finally, click "Create".

#### Create Google Cloud Service Account

1. **Open IAM & Admin**: In the Cloud Console, navigate to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts".
2. **Create Service Account**: Click "Create Service Account", enter a name, description, and then click "Create".
3. **Grant Permissions**: Assign the role of "Storage Object Admin" to the service account by selecting it from the role list.
4. **Create Key**: After creating the service account, click on it, go to the "Keys" tab, and then click "Add Key" > "Create new key". Choose JSON as the key type and click "Create". The key file will be downloaded automatically to your computer.

#### Create a Kubernetes Secret

- Use the **`kubectl create secret`** command to create a Kubernetes secret from the JSON key file. Replace **`<secret-name>`** with the desired name for your secret, **`<path-to-json-key-file>`** with the path to the JSON key file you downloaded, and **`<namespace>`** with the namespace where your deployment will be running.

```kubectl create secret generic <mysecret>  --from-file=gcp.json=</location/to/secret.json> --namespace=<namespace>```

#### Create an extra Volume where the GCSFS secret will be added in the values.yaml inside of the worker section
```
worker:
  extraVolumes:
    - name: gcsfs-creds
      secret:
        secretName: <secret name>
  extraVolumeMounts:
    - name: gcsfs-creds
      mountPath: "/etc/secrets"
      readOnly: true
```

#### Update the values.yaml with the GCS Logging Information below
Update the following Environment Variables in the global section:
```
global:
 state:
   storage:
     type: "GCS"

 logs:
   storage:
     type: "GCS"
   gcs:
     bucket: "<bucket name>"
     credentials: "/etc/secrets/gcp.json"
 
 extraEnv:
   - name: STATE_STORAGE_GCS_BUCKET_NAME
     value: <bucket name>
   - name: STATE_STORAGE_GCS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
     value: /etc/secrets/gcp.json
   - name: CONTAINER_ORCHESTRATOR_SECRET_NAME
     value: <name of secret>
   - name: CONTAINER_ORCHESTRATOR_SECRET_MOUNT_PATH
     value: /etc/secrets/
```

Than run:
`helm upgrade --install %RELEASE_NAME% airbyte/airbyte -n <NAMESPACE> --values /path/to/values.yaml --version 0.53.178`

### External Airbyte Database



:::info
This was tested using [Airbyte Helm Chart Version 0.50.13](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/airbyte/airbyte/0.50.13).
Previous or newer version can change how the external database can be configured.
:::


The Airbyte Database only works with Postgres 13.
Make sure the database is accessible inside the cluster using `busy-box` service using `telnet` or `ping` command.

:::warning
If you're using the external database for the first time you must ensure the database you're going to use exists. The default database Airbyte will try to use is `airbyte` but you can modified it in the `values.yaml`.
:::

:::warning
You can use only one database to a one Airbyte Helm deployment. If you try to use the same database for a different deployment it will have conflict with Temporal internal databases.
:::

Create a Kubernetes secret to store the database password.
Save the file as `db-secrets.yaml`.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  DATABASE_PASSWORD: <PASSWORD>
```

Run `kubectl apply -f db-secrets.yaml -n <NAMESPACE>` to create the secret in the namespace you're using Airbyte.

Afterward, modify the following blocks in the Helm Chart `values.yaml` file:
```yaml
postgresql:
  # Change the value from true to false.
  enabled: false
```
Then:
```yaml
externalDatabase:
  # Add the host, username and database name you're using.
  host: <HOST>
  user: <USERNAME>
  database: <DATABASE_NAME>
  password: ""
  existingSecret: "db-secrets"
  existingSecretPasswordKey: "DATABASE_PASSWORD"
  port: 5432
  jdbcUrl: ""
```
Keep password empty as the Chart will use the `db-secrets` value.
Edit only the host, username, and database name. If your database is using a differnet `port` or need an special `jdbcUrl` you can edit here.
This wasn't fully tested yet.

Next, reference the secret in the global section:
```yaml
global:
  database:
    secretName: "db-secrets"
    secretValue: "DATABASE_PASSWORD"
```

Unfortunately, the `airbyte-bootloader` configuration uses this variable. Future improvements are planned.

Upgrade the chart by running:
```shell
helm upgrade --install %RELEASE_NAME% airbyte/airbyte -n <NAMESPACE> --values /path/to/values.yaml --version 0.50.13
```
