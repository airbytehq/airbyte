# Deploy Airbyte on Azure (Cloud Shell)

This page guides you through deploying Airbyte Open Source on a [Microsoft Azure VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/) by setting up the deployment environment, installing and starting Airbyte, and connecting it to the VM.

:::info

The instructions have been tested on a standard DS1 v2 (1 vcpu, 3.5 GiB memory) Microsoft Azure VM with Ubuntu 18.04.

:::

## Set up the environment

Install Docker and Docker Compose in the VM:

1. [Create a new VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/) and [generate the SSH keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ssh-keys-portal) to connect to the VM. You’ll need the SSH keys to connect to the VM remotely later.

2. To connect to the VM, run the following command in the Azure Cloud Shell:

   ```bash
   ssh <admin username>@<IP address>
   ```

   If successfully connected to the VM, the working directory of Cloud Shell should look like this: `<admin username>@<virtual machine name>:~$`

3. To install Docker, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update -y
   sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release -y
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
   echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli -y
   sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
   ```

4. To install Docker Compose, run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin -y
   ```

5. Check Docker Compose version:

   ```bash
   docker compose version
   ```

6. Close the SSH connection to ensure that the group modification is considered:

   ```bash
   logout
   ```

7. Reconnect to the VM:

   ```bash
   ssh <admin username>@<IP address>
   ```

## Install and start Airbyte

Download Airbyte and deploy it in the VM using Docker Compose:

1. Ensure that you are connected to the VM:

   ```bash
   ssh <admin username>@<IP address>
   ```

2. Create and use a new directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir airbyte
   cd airbyte
   ```

3. Download Airbyte's install script from GitHub:

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airbytehq/airbyte/master/run-ab-platform.sh
   ```

4. To start Airbyte, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   chmod +x run-ab-platform.sh
   ./run-ab-platform.sh -b
   ```

## Connect to Airbyte

Test a remote connection to your VM locally and verify that Airbyte is up and running.

1. In your local machine, open a terminal.
2. Go to the folder where you stored the SSH key.
3. Create a SSH tunnel for `port 8000` by typing the following command:

   ```bash
   ssh -N -L 8000:localhost:8000 -i <your SSH key file> <admin username>@<IP address>
   ```

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You will see Airbyte’s landing page.

:::caution
For security reasons, we strongly recommend not exposing Airbyte on Internet available ports.
