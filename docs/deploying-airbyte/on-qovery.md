[Qovery](https://qovery.com) is a fully-managed cloud platform that runs on your AWS account where you can host static sites, backend APIs, databases, cron jobs, and all your other apps in one place.

Static sites are **completely free** on Qovery and include the following features:

- Continuous, automatic builds & deploys from GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.
- Automatic SSL certificates through [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).
- Free managed PostgreSQL.
- Free SSD storage.
- Unlimited collaborators.
- Unlimited [custom domains](https://docs.qovery.com/guides/getting-started/setting-custom-domain/).

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you already have a Airbyte project to deploy. If you need a project, use the [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started.md) to get started.

## Setup

Follow the procedure below to set up a Airbyte on Qovery:

### 1. Create a Qovery account.

Visit the [Qovery dashboard](https://console.qovery.com) to create an account if you don't already have one.

### 2. Create a project

Click on the create a project button and give a name to your project.

Click on next.

### 3. Add your Airbyte app

Click on the create an application button and select your Github or Gitlab repository where your Airbyte app is located.

Click on next.

### 4. Add a PostgreSQL database

Click on add a PostgreSQL database.

Select the version.

Give a name to your PostgreSQL databse.

Click on next.

### 5. Add a storage
