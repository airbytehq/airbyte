# Ignore manifest files in manifest-only connectors
# This is done due to prettier being overly opinionated on the formatting of quotes
# Ref: https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/973
# And it not allowing rule opt outs
# Ref: https://github.com/prettier/prettier/discussions/13925
# Instead we rely on the contribution service to format these files
# See: https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-connector
