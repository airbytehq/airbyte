# ## `poe connector` task
#
# The `poe connector` task is a shortcut to run any poe task in a connector's directory.
# Example usage:
#   poe connector <connector-name> <task> [args...]
#   poe connector source-hardcoded-records check-all
#   poe connector destination-motherduck check-all
#
# ## `poe source` and `poe destination` tasks
# The `source` and `destinations` tasks are thin wrappers around
# the `connector` task.
#
# Example usage:
#   poe source hardcoded-records check-all
#   poe destination motherduck check-all
