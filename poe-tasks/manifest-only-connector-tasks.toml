# A shared set of tasks for Manifest-Only Airbyte connectors.
#
# Referenced from `airbyte-integrations/connectors/poe_tasks.toml` to apply to
# all non-Java and non-Python connectors. By process of elimination, this covers
# the manifest-only connectors.
#
# If you find this tasks file is picked up by a connector that is *not* a
# manifest-only connector, simply add a `poe_tasks.toml` file in the connector's
# directory, and this will override the connectors' tasks to not use this file.
