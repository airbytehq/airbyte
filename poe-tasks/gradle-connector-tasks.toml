# A shared set of tasks for Java and Kotlin Airbyte connectors using Gradle.
#
# This file should be included in connectors' `poe_tasks.toml` as follows:
#
# ```toml
# `airbyte-integrations/connectors/<connector-name>/poe_tasks.toml`
#
# include = [
#     "${POE_GIT_DIR}/poe-tasks/gradle-connector-tasks.toml",
# ]
#
# Within any java connector directory, you can then run `poe gradle tasks` to
# see the full set of available Gradle tasks.
#
# Example usage:

# ```bash
# # First, move to the connector directory:
# cd airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-mysql
#
# # View available Gradle tasks:
# poe gradle tasks
#
# # Run a Gradle task (e.g. `build`):
# poe gradle build
# ```
