    Airbyte Configuration API

    Airbyte Configuration API [https://airbyte.io](https://airbyte.io).  This API is a collection of HTTP RPC-style methods. While it is not a REST API, those familiar with REST should find the conventions of this API recognizable.  Here are some conventions that this API follows: * All endpoints are http POST methods. * All endpoints accept data via `application/json` request bodies. The API does not accept any data via query params. * The naming convention for endpoints is: localhost:8000/{VERSION}/{METHOD_FAMILY}/{METHOD_NAME} e.g. `localhost:8000/v1/connections/create`. * For all `update` methods, the whole object must be passed in, even the fields that did not change.  Change Management: * The major version of the API endpoint can be determined / specified in the URL `localhost:8080/v1/connections/create` * Minor version bumps will be invisible to the end user. The user cannot specify minor versions in requests. * All backwards incompatible changes will happen in major version bumps. We will not make backwards incompatible changes in minor version bumps. Examples of non-breaking changes (includes but not limited to...):   * Adding fields to request or response bodies.   * Adding new HTTP endpoints.   # noqa: E501
