# üêô Octavia CLI

Octavia CLI is a tool to manage Airbyte configuration in YAML.
It has the following features:
* Scaffolding of a readable directory architecture that will host the YAML configs.
* Auto-generation of YAML config file that matches the resources' schemas.
* Manage Airbyte resources with YAML config files.
* Safe resources update through diff display and validation.
* Simple secret management to avoid versioning credentials.

## Disclaimer
The project is in **alpha** version. 
Readers can refer to our [opened GitHub issues](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea%2Foctavia-cli) to check the ongoing work on this project.

# Install

## 1. Install and run Docker
We are packaging this CLI as a Docker image to avoid dependency hell, **[please install and run Docker if you are not](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)**. 

## 2.a If you are using ZSH / Bash:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airbytehq/airbyte/master/octavia-cli/install.sh | bash
```

This script:
1. Pulls the [octavia-cli image](https://hub.docker.com/r/airbyte/octavia-cli/tags) from our Docker registry.
2. Creates an `octavia` alias in your profile.
3. Creates a `~/.octavia` file whose values are mapped to the octavia container's environment variables.

## 2.b If you want to directly run the CLI without alias in your current directory:
```bash
mkdir my_octavia_project_directory # Create your octavia project directory where YAML configurations will be stored.
docker run -i --rm -v ./my_octavia_project_directory:/home/octavia-project --network host -e AIRBYTE_URL="http://localhost:8000" airbyte/octavia-cli:dev
```


# Secret management
Sources and destinations configurations have credential fields that you **do not want to store as plain text and version on Git**.
`octavia` offers secret management through environment variables expansion:
```yaml
configuration:
  password: ${MY_PASSWORD}
```
If you have set a  `MY_PASSWORD` environment variable, `octavia apply` will load its value into the `password` field. 


# Developing locally
1. Install Python 3.8.12. We suggest doing it through `pyenv`
2. Create a virtualenv: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtualenv: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dev dependencies: `pip install -e .\[tests\]`
5. Install `pre-commit` hooks: `pre-commit install`
6. Run the unittest suite: `pytest --cov=octavia_cli`
7. Iterate: please check the [Contributing](#contributing) for instructions on contributing.
