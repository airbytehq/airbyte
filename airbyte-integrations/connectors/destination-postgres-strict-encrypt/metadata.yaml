      2.0.0:
        message: >
          This version introduces [Destinations V2](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2/#what-is-destinations-v2), which provides better error handling, incremental delivery of data for large syncs, and improved final table structures. 
          To review the breaking changes, and how to upgrade, see [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2/#quick-start-to-upgrading). 
          These changes will likely require updates to downstream dbt / SQL models, which we walk through [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2/#updating-downstream-transformations).
          Selecting `Upgrade` will upgrade **all** connections using this destination at their next sync. For more controlled upgrade [see instructions](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2/#upgrading-connections-one-by-one-with-dual-writing).
