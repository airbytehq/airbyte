# Source Scaffold Java Jdbc

This is the repository for the Scaffold Java Jdbc source connector in Java.
For information about how to use this connector within Airbyte, see [the User Documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/scaffold-java-jdbc).

## Local development

#### Building via Gradle
From the Airbyte repository root, run:
```
./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:connectors:source-scaffold-java-jdbc:build
```

#### Create credentials
**If you are a community contributor**, generate the necessary credentials and place them in `secrets/config.json` conforming to the spec file in `src/main/resources/spec.json`.
Note that the `secrets` directory is git-ignored by default, so there is no danger of accidentally checking in sensitive information.

**If you are an Airbyte core member**, follow the [instructions](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development#using-credentials-in-ci) to set up the credentials.

### Locally running the connector docker image

#### Build
Build the connector image via Gradle:
```
./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:connectors:source-scaffold-java-jdbc:buildConnectorImage
```

Once built, the docker image name and tag will be `airbyte/source-scaffold-java-jdbc:dev`.

#### Run
Then run any of the connector commands as follows:
```
docker run --rm airbyte/source-scaffold-java-jdbc:dev spec
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets airbyte/source-scaffold-java-jdbc:dev check --config /secrets/config.json
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets airbyte/source-scaffold-java-jdbc:dev discover --config /secrets/config.json
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets -v $(pwd)/integration_tests:/integration_tests airbyte/source-scaffold-java-jdbc:dev read --config /secrets/config.json --catalog /integration_tests/configured_catalog.json
```

## Testing
We use `JUnit` for Java tests.

### Unit and Integration Tests
Place unit tests under `src/test/...`
Place integration tests in `src/test-integration/...` 

#### Acceptance Tests
Airbyte has a standard test suite that all source connectors must pass. Implement the `TODO`s in
`src/test-integration/java/io/airbyte/integrations/sources/scaffold_java_jdbcSourceAcceptanceTest.java`.

### Using gradle to run tests
All commands should be run from airbyte project root.
To run unit tests:
```
./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:connectors:source-scaffold-java-jdbc:unitTest
```
To run acceptance and custom integration tests:
```
./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:connectors:source-scaffold-java-jdbc:integrationTest
```
