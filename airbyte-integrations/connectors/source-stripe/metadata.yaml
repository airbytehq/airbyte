      4.0.0:
        message:
          Version 4.0.0 changes the cursors in most of the Stripe streams that
          support incremental sync mode. This is done to not only sync the data that
          was created since previous sync, but also the data that was modified. A
          schema refresh of all effected streams is required to use the new cursor
          format.

      5.0.0:
        message:
          Version 5.0.0 introduces fixes for the `CheckoutSessions`, `CheckoutSessionsLineItems`
          and `Refunds` streams. The cursor field is changed for the `CheckoutSessionsLineItems`
          and `Refunds` streams. This will prevent data loss during incremental syncs.
          Also, the `Invoices`, `Subscriptions` and `SubscriptionSchedule` stream
          schemas have been updated.
