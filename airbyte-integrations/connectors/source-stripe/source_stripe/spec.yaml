        When set, the connector will always re-export data from the past N days,
        where N is the value set here. This is useful if your data is frequently updated
        after creation. Applies only to streams that do not support event-based incremental syncs: CheckoutSessionLineItems, 
        Events, SetupAttempts, ShippingRates, BalanceTransactions, Files, FileLinks. More info <a

      description: >-
        The time increment used by the connector when requesting data from the Stripe API. The bigger the value is,
        the less requests will be made and faster the sync will be. On the other hand, the more seldom
        the state is persisted.

      description: >-
        The number of worker thread to use for the sync. The bigger the value is, the faster the sync will be.
        Be careful as rate limiting is not implemented.
      order: 5
