        message: >
          **Do not upgrade until you have run a test upgrade as outlined [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2/#testing-destinations-v2-for-a-single-connection)**.

          This version introduces [Destinations V2](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2/#what-is-destinations-v2), which provides better error handling, incremental delivery of data for large syncs, and improved final table structures. To review the breaking changes, and how to upgrade, see [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2/#quick-start-to-upgrading). These changes will likely require updates to downstream dbt / SQL models, which we walk through [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2/#updating-downstream-transformations).

          Selecting `Upgrade` will upgrade **all** connections using this destination at their next sync. You can manually sync existing connections prior to the next scheduled sync to start the upgrade early.
