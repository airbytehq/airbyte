# Cart.com

Cart.com is a straightforward CRUD REST API. Connector is implemented with [Airbyte CDK](https://docs.airbyte.io/connector-development/cdk-python).

It consists of some REST resources like shopping_cart, users, products, etcâ€¦ each of which have a list endpoint with a timestamp filter that can be used to perform incremental syncs. 

Auth uses a pre-created API token which can be created in the UI. 
Pagination uses a cursor pagination strategy. 
Rate limiting is just a standard exponential backoff when you see a 429 HTTP status code. 

See the links below for information about specific streams and some nuances about the connector:
