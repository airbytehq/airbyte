#  THIS TEST IS COMMENTED OUT. Tests are supposed to accept
#  `state = {cursor_field: value}`. When we have dependent endpoint path
#  `path_begin/{some_id}/path_end` we need a complex state like below:
#  `{"id1": {cursor_field: value}, "id2": {cursor_field: value}...}`
#  The test currently is not supposed to accept this desired construction,
#  so it is commented out
