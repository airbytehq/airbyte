        This method returns an iterable (typically a generator of AirbyteMessages via yield) containing state messages received
        in the input message stream. Outputting a state message means that every AirbyteRecordMessage which came before it has been
        successfully persisted to the destination. This is used to ensure fault tolerance in the case that a sync fails before fully completing,
        then the source is given the last state message output from this method as the starting point of the next sync.
