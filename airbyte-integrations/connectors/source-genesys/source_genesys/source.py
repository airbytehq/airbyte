#         This is useful if the API offers reads by groups or filters, and can be paired with the state object to make reads efficient. See the "concepts"
#         section of the docs for more information.

#         This means that data in a slice is usually closely related to a stream's cursor_field and stream_state.

#         craft that specific request.

#         this would be to consult the stream state object for the last synced date, then return a slice containing each date from the last synced date
#         till now. The request_params function would then grab the date from the stream_slice and make it part of the request by injecting it into
#         the date query param.
