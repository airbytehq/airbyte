# See [Source Acceptance Tests](https://docs.airbyte.io/connector-development/testing-connectors/source-acceptance-tests-reference)
# for more information about how to configure these tests

# The 'future_state_path' field is commented out to skip the test `test_state_with_abnormally_large_values`
# as a temporary solution not to block publishing of new versions. The reason is
# When specifying future date in the state the current implementation of the connector produces records for [current_date, current_date] slice, 
# and it makes SAT fail, because it should produce no records with the state with abnormally large values
