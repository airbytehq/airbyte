      2.0.0:
        message:
          In this release, the default primary key for stream Export has been
          deleted, allowing users to select the key that best fits their data. Refreshing
          the source schema and resetting affected streams is necessary only if new
          primary keys are to be applied following the upgrade.
        upgradeDeadline: "2023-11-30"
      1.0.0:
        message:
          In this release, the datetime field of stream engage has had its
          type changed from date-time to string due to inconsistent data from Mixpanel.
          Additionally, the primary key for stream export has been fixed to uniquely
          identify records. Users will need to refresh the source schema and reset
          affected streams after upgrading.
