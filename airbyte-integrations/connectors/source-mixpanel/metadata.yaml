      3.0.0:
        message:
          In this release, state for CohortMembers is reset and migrated to new empty
          per-partition state automatically. It means that on next incremental sync
          there actually will be one full read and new state will be released.
          Key for CohortMembers stream was changed to new unique key based on 
          distinct_id and cohort_id fields since previous key was not unique and 
          didn't support possibility for user be in a few different cohorts

      2.0.0:
        message:
          In this release, the default primary key for stream Export has been
          deleted, allowing users to select the key that best fits their data. Refreshing
          the source schema and resetting affected streams is necessary only if new
          primary keys are to be applied following the upgrade.

      1.0.0:
        message:
          In this release, the datetime field of stream engage has had its
          type changed from date-time to string due to inconsistent data from Mixpanel.
          Additionally, the primary key for stream export has been fixed to uniquely
          identify records. Users will need to refresh the source schema and reset
          affected streams after upgrading.
