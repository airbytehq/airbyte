  # These tests are disabled because of the issues https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/12665
  # and https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/12467. Instead, custom integration tests are implemented.
  # As soon as the above issues are resolved, standard SATs can be enabled and custom tests removed.
