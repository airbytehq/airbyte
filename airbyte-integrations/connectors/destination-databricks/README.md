# Destination Databricks Lakehouse

This is the repository for the Databricks destination connector in Java.
For information about how to use this connector within Airbyte, see [the User Documentation](https://docs.airbyte.io/integrations/destinations/databricks).

## Databricks JDBC Driver
This connector requires a JDBC driver to connect to Databricks cluster. Before using this connector, you must agree to the [JDBC ODBC driver license](https://databricks.com/jdbc-odbc-driver-license). This means that you can only use this driver to connector third party applications to Apache Spark SQL within a Databricks offering using the ODBC and/or JDBC protocols.

## Local development

#### Building via Gradle
From the Airbyte repository root, run:
```
./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:connectors:destination-databricks:build
```

#### Create credentials
**If you are a community contributor**, you will need access to AWS S3, Azure blob storage, and Databricks cluster to run the integration tests:

- Create a Databricks cluster. See [documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/create.html).
- Create an S3 bucket. See [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys).
- Create an Azure storage container.
- Grant the Databricks cluster full access to the S3 bucket and Azure container. Or mount it as Databricks File System (DBFS). See [documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/data/data-sources/aws/amazon-s3.html).
- Place both Databricks and S3 credentials in `sample_secrets/config.json`, which conforms to the spec file in `src/main/resources/spec.json`.
- Place both Databricks and Azure credentials in `sample_secrets/azure_config.json`, which conforms to the spec file in `src/main/resources/spec.json`.
- Rename the directory from `sample_secrets` to `secrets`.
- Note that the `secrets` directory is git-ignored by default, so there is no danger of accidentally checking in sensitive information.

**If you are an Airbyte core member**:

- Get the `destination databricks creds` secrets on Last Pass, and put it in `sample_secrets/config.json`.
- Rename the directory from `sample_secrets` to `secrets`.

### Locally running the connector docker image

#### Build
Build the connector image via Gradle:

```
./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:connectors:destination-databricks:buildConnectorImage
```
Once built, the docker image name and tag on your host will be `airbyte/destination-databricks:dev`.
the Dockerfile.

#### Run
Then run any of the connector commands as follows:
```
docker run --rm airbyte/destination-databricks:dev spec
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets airbyte/destination-databricks:dev check --config /secrets/config.json
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets airbyte/destination-databricks:dev discover --config /secrets/config.json
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets -v $(pwd)/integration_tests:/integration_tests airbyte/destination-databricks:dev read --config /secrets/config.json --catalog /integration_tests/configured_catalog.json
```

## Testing
We use `JUnit` for Java tests.

### Unit and Integration Tests
Place unit tests under `src/test/io/airbyte/integrations/destinations/databricks`.

#### Acceptance Tests
Airbyte has a standard test suite that all destination connectors must pass. Implement the `TODO`s in
`src/test-integration/java/io/airbyte/integrations/destinations/databricksDestinationAcceptanceTest.java`.

### Using gradle to run tests
All commands should be run from airbyte project root.
To run unit tests:
```
./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:connectors:destination-databricks:unitTest
```
To run acceptance and custom integration tests:
```
./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:connectors:destination-databricks:integrationTest
```

## Dependency Management

### Publishing a new version of the connector
You've checked out the repo, implemented a million dollar feature, and you're ready to share your changes with the world. Now what?
1. Make sure your changes are passing our test suite: `airbyte-ci connectors --name=destination-databricks test`
2. Bump the connector version in `metadata.yaml`: increment the `dockerImageTag` value. Please follow [semantic versioning for connectors](https://docs.airbyte.com/contributing-to-airbyte/resources/pull-requests-handbook/#semantic-versioning-for-connectors).
3. Make sure the `metadata.yaml` content is up to date.
4. Make the connector documentation and its changelog is up to date (`docs/integrations/destinations/databricks.md`).
5. Create a Pull Request: use [our PR naming conventions](https://docs.airbyte.com/contributing-to-airbyte/resources/pull-requests-handbook/#pull-request-title-convention).
6. Pat yourself on the back for being an awesome contributor.
7. Someone from Airbyte will take a look at your PR and iterate with you to merge it into master.
