    Data is written to KvDB in the following format:
        key: stream_name__ab__<record_extraction_timestamp>
        value: a JSON object representing the record's data

    This is because unless a data source explicitly designates a primary key, we don't know what to key the record on.
    Since KvDB allows reading records with certain prefixes, we treat it more like a message queue, expecting the reader to
    read messages with a particular prefix e.g: name__ab__123, where 123 is the timestamp they last read data from.
