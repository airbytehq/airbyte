      2.0.0:
        message: >-
          This version replaces the `Property History` stream in favor of creating 3 different streams: `Contacts`, `Companies`, and `Deals`, which can now all fetch their property history.
          It will affect only users who use `Property History` stream, who will need to fix schema conflicts and sync `Contacts Property History` stream instead of `Property History`.
