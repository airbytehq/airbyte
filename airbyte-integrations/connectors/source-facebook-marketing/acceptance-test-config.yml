      # Ad Insights API has estimated metrics in response, which is calculated based on another metrics.
      # Sometimes API doesn't return estimated metrics. E.g, cost_per_estimated_ad_recallers is calculated
      # as total amount spent divided by estimated ad recall lift rate. When second metric is equal to zero
      # API may or may not return value. Such behavior causes sequential reads test failing.
      # Because one read response contains this metric, and other doesn't.
      # Therefore, it's needed to ignore fields like this in API responses.
