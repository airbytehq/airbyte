# Chargebee Source

This is the repository for the Chargebee configuration based source connector.
For information about how to use this connector within Airbyte, see [the documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/chargebee).

## Local development

#### Create credentials
**If you are a community contributor**, follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/chargebee)
to generate the necessary credentials. Then create a file `secrets/config.json` conforming to the `source_chargebee/spec.yaml` file.
Note that any directory named `secrets` is gitignored across the entire Airbyte repo, so there is no danger of accidentally checking in sensitive information.
See `integration_tests/sample_config.json` for a sample config file.

**If you are an Airbyte core member**, copy the credentials in Lastpass under the secret name `source chargebee test creds`
and place them into `secrets/config.json`.

### Locally running the connector docker image



#### Use `airbyte-ci` to build your connector
The Airbyte way of building this connector is to use our `airbyte-ci` tool.
You can follow install instructions [here](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-ci/connectors/pipelines/README.md#L1).
Then running the following command will build your connector:

```bash
airbyte-ci connectors --name=source-chargebee build
```
Once the command is done, you will find your connector image in your local docker registry: `airbyte/source-chargebee:dev`.

##### Customizing our build process
When contributing on our connector you might need to customize the build process to add a system dependency or set an env var.
You can customize our build process by adding a `build_customization.py` module to your connector.
This module should contain a `pre_connector_install` and `post_connector_install` async function that will mutate the base image and the connector container respectively.
It will be imported at runtime by our build process and the functions will be called if they exist.

Here is an example of a `build_customization.py` module:
```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    # Feel free to check the dagger documentation for more information on the Container object and its methods.
    # https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/sdk-python-v0.6.4/
    from dagger import Container


async def pre_connector_install(base_image_container: Container) -> Container:
    return await base_image_container.with_env_variable("MY_PRE_BUILD_ENV_VAR", "my_pre_build_env_var_value")

async def post_connector_install(connector_container: Container) -> Container:
    return await connector_container.with_env_variable("MY_POST_BUILD_ENV_VAR", "my_post_build_env_var_value")
```

#### Build your own connector image
This connector is built using our dynamic built process in `airbyte-ci`.
The base image used to build it is defined within the metadata.yaml file under the `connectorBuildOptions`.
The build logic is defined using [Dagger](https://dagger.io/) [here](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-ci/connectors/pipelines/pipelines/builds/python_connectors.py).
It does not rely on a Dockerfile.

If you would like to patch our connector and build your own a simple approach would be to:

1. Create your own Dockerfile based on the latest version of the connector image.
```Dockerfile
FROM airbyte/source-chargebee:latest

COPY . ./airbyte/integration_code
RUN pip install ./airbyte/integration_code

# The entrypoint and default env vars are already set in the base image
# ENV AIRBYTE_ENTRYPOINT "python /airbyte/integration_code/main.py"
# ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/airbyte/integration_code/main.py"]
```
Please use this as an example. This is not optimized.

2. Build your image:
```bash
docker build -t airbyte/source-chargebee:dev .
# Running the spec command against your patched connector
docker run airbyte/source-chargebee:dev spec
```
#### Run
Then run any of the connector commands as follows:
```
docker run --rm airbyte/source-chargebee:dev spec
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets airbyte/source-chargebee:dev check --config /secrets/config.json
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets airbyte/source-chargebee:dev discover --config /secrets/config.json
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets -v $(pwd)/integration_tests:/integration_tests airbyte/source-chargebee:dev read --config /secrets/config.json --catalog /integration_tests/configured_catalog.json
```

## Testing
You can run our full test suite locally using [`airbyte-ci`](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-ci/connectors/pipelines/README.md):
```bash
airbyte-ci connectors --name=source-chargebee test
```

### Customizing acceptance Tests
Customize `acceptance-test-config.yml` file to configure tests. See [Connector Acceptance Tests](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/testing-connectors/connector-acceptance-tests-reference) for more information.
If your connector requires to create or destroy resources for use during acceptance tests create fixtures for it and place them inside integration_tests/acceptance.py.

## Dependency Management
All of your dependencies should go in `setup.py`, NOT `requirements.txt`. The requirements file is only used to connect internal Airbyte dependencies in the monorepo for local development.
We split dependencies between two groups, dependencies that are:
* required for your connector to work need to go to `MAIN_REQUIREMENTS` list.
* required for the testing need to go to `TEST_REQUIREMENTS` list

### Publishing a new version of the connector
You've checked out the repo, implemented a million dollar feature, and you're ready to share your changes with the world. Now what?
1. Make sure your changes are passing our test suite: `airbyte-ci connectors --name=source-chargebee test`
2. Bump the connector version in `metadata.yaml`: increment the `dockerImageTag` value. Please follow [semantic versioning for connectors](https://docs.airbyte.com/contributing-to-airbyte/resources/pull-requests-handbook/#semantic-versioning-for-connectors).
3. Make sure the `metadata.yaml` content is up to date.
4. Make the connector documentation and its changelog is up to date (`docs/integrations/sources/chargebee.md`).
5. Create a Pull Request: use [our PR naming conventions](https://docs.airbyte.com/contributing-to-airbyte/resources/pull-requests-handbook/#pull-request-title-convention).
6. Pat yourself on the back for being an awesome contributor.
7. Someone from Airbyte will take a look at your PR and iterate with you to merge it into master.
