The featured video animates NASA images of all eight planets in our Solar System to show them spinning side-by-side for an easy comparison. In the time-lapse video, a day on Earth -- one Earth rotation -- takes just a few seconds.  Jupiter rotates the fastest, while Venus spins not only the slowest (can you see it?), but backwards.  The inner rocky planets across the top underwent dramatic spin-altering collisions during the early days of the Solar System.  Why planets spin and tilt as they do remains a topic of research with much insight gained from modern computer modeling and the recent discovery and analysis of hundreds of exoplanets: planets orbiting other stars.", "media_type": "video", "service_version": "v1", "title": "Planets of the Solar System: Tilts and Spins", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/my1euFQHH-o?rel=0"}, "emitted_at": 1666637798523}

They are a rarely seen form of lightning confirmed only about 35 years ago: red sprites. Research has shown that following a powerful positive cloud-to-ground lightning strike, red sprites may start as 100-meter balls of ionized air that shoot down from about 80-km high at 10 percent the speed of light. They are quickly followed by a group of upward streaking ionized balls. The featured image was taken late last month from the Jeseniky Mountains in northern Moravia in the Czech Republic. The distance to the red sprites is about 200 kilometers. Red sprites take only a fraction of a second to occur and are best seen when powerful thunderstorms are visible from the side.

Visible as the bright curving streak around the image center, the snaking filament's full extent was estimated to be over half of the Sun's radius -- more than 350,000 kilometers long. A filament is composed of  hot gas held aloft by the Sun's magnetic field, so that viewed from the side it would appear as a raised prominence.  A different, smaller prominence is simultaneously visible at the Sun's edge. The featured image is in false-color and color-inverted to highlight not only the filament but the Sun's carpet chromosphere.  The bright dot on the upper right is actually a dark sunspot about the size of the Earth.  Solar filaments typically last from hours to days, eventually collapsing to return hot plasma back to the Sun. Sometimes, though, they explode and expel particles into the Solar System, some of which trigger auroras on Earth. The pictured filament appeared in early September and continued to hold steady for about a week.", "hdurl": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2209/SnakingFilament_Friedman_960.jpg", "media_type": "image", "service_version": "v1", "title": "A Long Snaking Filament on the Sun", "url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2209/SnakingFilament_Friedman_960.jpg"}, "emitted_at": 1666637798524}

Roughly the same angular size as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Great Lacerta Nebula can be found toward the constellation of the Lizard (Lacerta). The emission nebula is difficult to see with wide-field binoculars because it is so faint, but also usually difficult to see with a large telescope because it is so great in angle -- spanning about three degrees. The depth, breadth, waves, and beauty of the nebula -- cataloged as Sharpless 126 (Sh2-126) -- can best be seen and appreciated with a long duration camera exposure. The featured image is one such combined exposure -- in this case 10 hours over five different colors and over six nights during this past June and July at the IC Astronomy Observatory in Spain. The hydrogen gas in the Great Lacerta Nebula glows red because it is excited by light from the bright star 10 Lacertae, one of the bright blue stars just above the red-glowing nebula's center.  The stars and nebula are about 1,200 light years distant.
