class PlaidTransactionExtractor(RecordExtractor):
    """
    Record extractor that searches a decoded response over multiple paths. Each field is
    a separate path that points to an array (unless it doesn't exist at all).

    If the field path points to an array, that array is returned.
    If the field path points to a non-existing path, an empty array is returned.

    Example of instantiating this transform:
    ```
      extractor:
        type: CustomRecordExtractor
        class_name: source_plaid.components.PlaidTransactionExtractor
        field_path:
          - "added"
          - "modified"
    ```

        field_path (list[str]): Path to the fields that should be extracted
        decoder (Decoder): The decoder responsible to transfom the response in a Mapping
