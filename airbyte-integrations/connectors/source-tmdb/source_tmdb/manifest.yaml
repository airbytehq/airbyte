                ako nekonečný sen. Všetko okolo vás je nedokonalou xeroxovou kópiou
                seba samého. Chodíte do práce, pozeráte sa na televíziu a ste vďační
                za to, keď občas stratíte vedomie a neviete o svete. Ľudí s podobnými
                problémami moc nie je, ale mladý úspešný úradník, ktorý si hovorí Jack,
                je jedným z nich. Má slušnú prácu, zarába slušné peniaze, ale trpí najťažšou
                formou nespavosti. Na služobnej ceste sa Jack zoznámi s Tylerom Durdenom,
                ktorý mu ponúkne príbytok pod podmienkou, že mu vrazí poriadnu ranu.
                Táto "výmena názorov" sa obom zapáči a čoskoro vznikne prvý Klub bitkárov.
                Miesto, kde môžu mladí muži, znechutení svetom, odložiť svoje starosti
                a stať sa na pár minút zvieratami.
