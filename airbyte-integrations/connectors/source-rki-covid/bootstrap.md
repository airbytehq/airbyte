The (Robert Koch-Institut - von Marlon LÃ¼ckert) Covid-19 is [a REST based API](https://api.corona-zahlen.org/). 
Connector is implemented with [Airbyte CDK](https://docs.airbyte.io/connector-development/cdk-python).

## Cases In Germany Covid api stream
The basic entry stream is 'germany'. All other streams are extended version of base stream and passing parameters also result in sliced data.
For production, every developer application can view multiple streams.
