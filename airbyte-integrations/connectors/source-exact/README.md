# Exact Source

This is the repository for the Exact source connector, written in Python.

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- Python `~= 3.11.0`
- Poetry `~= 1.8` - installation instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

Note: it is quite difficult to work with Poetry 1.8 at the moment because tools like Homebrew update Poetry to 2.0 
which have some differences. Create a virtual environment and install Poetry version 1.8 and use Poetry from there.

### Create credentials

**If you are a community contributor**, follow the instructions in
the [documentation](https://docs.airbyte.io/integrations/sources/exact)
to generate the necessary credentials. Then create a file `secrets/config.json` conforming to the
`source_exact/spec.yaml` file.
Note that any directory named `secrets` is gitignored across the entire Airbyte repo, so there is no danger of
accidentally checking in sensitive information.
See `integration_tests/sample_config.json` for a sample config file.

**If you are an Airbyte core member**, copy the credentials in Lastpass under the secret name `source exact test creds`
and place them into `secrets/config.json`.

### Installing the connector

From this connector directory, run:

```shell
poetry install --with dev
```

### Locally running the connector

Using Poetry

```shell
poetry run source-exact spec
poetry run source-exact check
```

Or with the current virtual environment activated

```shell
python main.py spec
python main.py check --config secrets/config.json
python main.py discover --config secrets/config.json
python main.py read --config secrets/config.json --catalog integration_tests/configured_catalog.json
```

### Optional flags

```
--debug
```

## Testing

Make sure to familiarize yourself
with [pytest test discovery](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html#test-discovery) to know how your test
files and methods should be named.
First install test dependencies into your virtual environment:

```shell
poetry install --with dev
```

### Unit Tests

To run unit tests locally, from the connector directory `source_exact` run:


Via airbyte-cdk
```shell
airbyte-cdk image test
```

## Exact Online API Comments
For some endpoints Exact Online has three distinct versions which roughly yield the same information. These are 
- Single
- Bulk
- Sync

When Extracting with Airbyte the preference is from Sync, Bulk, Single. 

As per Exact Online's documentation.
> The sync api's are also developed to give best performance when retrieving records. Because of performance and the intended purpose of the api's, only the timestamp field is allowed as parameter.
The single and bulk apiâ€™s are designed for a different purpose. They provide ability to retrieve specific record or a set of records which meet certain conditions.

## ToDo List
- [ ] Improve logging so that in the case of a refresh of a token before its expiry date does not only give a 401 but also its message
  - `401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://start.exactonline.nl/api/oauth2/token`
- [ ] make FinancialGLAccountClassificationMappings and FinancialReceivablesList only full refresh or test the 
  incremental sync better
-
