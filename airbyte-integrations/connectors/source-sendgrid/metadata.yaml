        message:
          This release makes several changes that upgrade the Sendgrid connector.
          The configuration options have been renamed to `api_key` and `start_date`. `start_date` is now required.
          The `unsubscribe_groups` stream has been removed. It was the same as `suppression_groups`. You can use that and get the same data.
          The `single_sends` stream has been renamed `singlesend_stats`. This is closer to the data and API.
          The `segments` stream has been upgraded to use the Sendgrid 2.0 API because the older one has been deprecated. The schema has changed as a result.
          To ensure a smooth upgrade, please refresh your schemas and reset your data before resuming syncs.
