        message:
          This release makes several changes that upgrade the Sendgrid connector.
          The configuration options have been renamed to `api_key` and `start_date`.
          `start_date` is now required. The `unsubscribe_groups` stream has been removed.
          It was the same as `suppression_groups`. You can use that and get the same
          data. The `single_sends` stream has been renamed `singlesend_stats`. This
          is closer to the data and API. The `segments` stream has been upgraded to
          use the Sendgrid 2.0 API because the older one has been deprecated. The
          schema has changed as a result. To ensure a smooth upgrade, please refresh
          your schemas and reset your data before resuming syncs.
