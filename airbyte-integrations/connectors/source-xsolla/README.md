- You can use this connector as any other connector in Airbyte Marketplace.

## Local Development
We recommend you use the Connector Builder to edit this connector.

But, if you want to develop this connector locally, you can use the following steps.

### Environment Setup
You will need `airbyte-ci` installed. You can find the documentation [here](airbyte-ci).

### Build
This will create a dev image (`source-xsolla:dev`) that you can use to test the connector locally.
```bash
airbyte-ci connectors --name=source-xsolla build
```

### Test
This will run the acceptance tests for the connector.
```bash
airbyte-ci connectors --name=source-xsolla test
```
