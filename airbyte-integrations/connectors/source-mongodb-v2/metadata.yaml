        message: >
          **We advise against upgrading until you have run a test upgrade as outlined [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/mongodb-v2-migrations).**  This version brings a host of updates to the MongoDB source connector, significantly increasing its scalability and reliability, especially for large collections. As of this version with checkpointing, [CDC incremental updates](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/cdc) and improved schema discovery, this connector is also now [certified](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/). Selecting `Upgrade` will upgrade **all** connections using this source, require you to reconfigure the source, then run a full reset on **all** of your connections.
