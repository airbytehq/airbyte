        message:
          "**Important: This version introduces multiple database support for MongoDB v2 source connector.**

          This update changes the configuration schema from a single `database` field to a `databases` array field,
          allowing you to sync data from multiple MongoDB databases in a single connection.

          **What to expect when upgrading:**

          1. You will need to reconfigure your MongoDB source connector to use the new `databases` array field
          2. If you're using CDC incremental sync mode, we recommend testing this upgrade in a staging environment first

          **Migration steps:**

          1. After upgrading, edit your MongoDB source configuration
          2. Add your existing database to the new `databases` array field
          3. Add any additional databases you want to sync
          4. Save the configuration and run a sync

          For more information, please refer to the [MongoDB v2 documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/mongodb-v2) and the [migration guide](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/mongodb-v2-migrations).

        message:
          "**We advise against upgrading until you have run a test upgrade
          as outlined [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/mongodb-v2-migrations).**  This
          version brings a host of updates to the MongoDB source connector, significantly
          increasing its scalability and reliability, especially for large collections.
          As of this version with checkpointing, [CDC incremental updates](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/cdc)
          and improved schema discovery, this connector is also now [certified](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/).
          Selecting `Upgrade` will upgrade **all** connections using this source,
          require you to reconfigure the source, then run a full reset on **all**
          of your connections.
