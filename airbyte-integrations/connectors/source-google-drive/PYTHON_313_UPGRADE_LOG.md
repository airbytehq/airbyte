# Python 3.13.9 Upgrade Log for source-google-drive

## Initial State
- **Connector Version**: 0.4.10
- **Python Constraint**: ^3.10,<3.12
- **CDK Version**: ^7.0.1
- **Base Image**: docker.io/airbyte/python-connector-base:4.0.2@sha256:9fdb1888c4264cf6fee473649ecb593f56f58e5d0096a87ee0b231777e2e3e73

## Upgrade Steps

### Step 1: Unpin Python Version Constraint
**Action**: Changed Python version constraint in pyproject.toml from `^3.10,<3.12` to `^3.10`
**Reason**: Remove the upper bound to allow Python 3.13.9

### Step 2: Attempt to Lock Dependencies
**Command**: `poetry lock`
**Result**: FAILED
**Error**: The airbyte-cdk package (versions 7.0.1 through 7.4.0) requires Python <3.14,>=3.10, which conflicts with our desire to support Python 3.13.

**Analysis**: 
- The published versions of airbyte-cdk on PyPI (up to 7.4.0) have a Python constraint of `<3.14,>=3.10`
- However, the airbyte-python-cdk repository source code shows support for Python 3.13 in its pyproject.toml (`python = ">=3.10,<3.14"`)
- The tool.airbyte_ci section explicitly lists Python 3.13 as a supported version
- This suggests that either:
  1. A newer version of the CDK needs to be published that supports Python 3.13, OR
  2. We need to use a development version from the repository

### Step 3: Check for Newer CDK Versions
**Command**: `pip index versions airbyte-cdk`
**Result**: Latest published version is 7.4.0
**Status**: The published version still has the Python <3.14 constraint

### Step 3 (Revised): Adjust Python Version Constraint
**Action**: Changed Python version constraint to `>=3.10,<3.14` to match the CDK's requirement
**Reason**: The airbyte-cdk package requires Python <3.14, which includes Python 3.13.x versions

**Command**: `poetry lock`
**Result**: SUCCESS - Lock file generated successfully

### Step 4: Install Dependencies
**Command**: `poetry install`
**Result**: SUCCESS - All 135 packages installed successfully with Python 3.13.9

**Key Findings**:
- No dependency conflicts encountered
- The CDK version 7.3.9 supports Python 3.13 (constraint is >=3.10,<3.14)
- All Google API client libraries are compatible with Python 3.13
- The connector successfully installed with Python 3.13.9

## Summary of Changes
1. **Python Version Constraint**: Changed from `^3.10,<3.12` to `>=3.10,<3.14`
   - This allows Python 3.13.x while respecting the CDK's upper bound
2. **No Dependency Upgrades Required**: All existing dependencies are compatible with Python 3.13

### Step 5: Run Unit Tests
**Command**: `poetry run poe test-unit-tests`
**Result**: SUCCESS - All 35 tests passed
**Details**: 
- Tests ran successfully with Python 3.13.9
- Some deprecation warnings from dependencies (serpyco_rs) but no failures
- All file reader, upload, and utility tests passed

### Step 6: Run Integration Tests
**Command**: `poetry run poe test-integration-tests`
**Result**: SKIPPED - No integration test files present in the connector
**Note**: This connector does not have integration tests defined

### Step 7: Update Base Image
**Action**: Updated metadata.yaml to use Python 3.13 base image
**Old Image**: docker.io/airbyte/python-connector-base:4.0.2@sha256:9fdb1888c4264cf6fee473649ecb593f56f58e5d0096a87ee0b231777e2e3e73
**New Image**: docker.io/airbyte/python-connector-base:4.1.0@sha256:1d1aa21d34e851df4e8a87b391c27724c06e2597608e7161f4d167be853bd7b6

### Step 8: Run Image Smoke Test
**Command**: `poetry run airbyte-cdk image test`
**Result**: MOSTLY SUCCESS
**Details**:
- Docker image built successfully with Python 3.13.9 base
- Spec command test: PASSED
- Check command tests: 2 FAILED (expected - missing credentials files)
- Read command tests: SKIPPED (expected - missing credentials)

**Analysis of Failures**:
The 2 failures are expected and not related to Python 3.13 compatibility:
- Tests require `secrets/config.json` and `secrets/oauth_config.json` files
- These credential files are only available in CI with proper secrets configured
- The failures are FileNotFoundError, not Python compatibility issues
- The spec command passed, confirming the image works correctly with Python 3.13.9

## Final Summary

### Successful Upgrade to Python 3.13.9
✅ **Python Version**: Successfully upgraded from 3.10-3.11 to 3.10-3.13
✅ **Dependencies**: All dependencies compatible with Python 3.13.9
✅ **Unit Tests**: All 35 tests passing
✅ **Docker Image**: Successfully built with Python 3.13.9 base image
✅ **Spec Command**: Working correctly in Docker container

### Changes Made
1. **pyproject.toml**: Updated Python constraint from `^3.10,<3.12` to `>=3.10,<3.14`
2. **metadata.yaml**: Updated base image to Python 3.13 version (4.1.0)
3. **poetry.lock**: Regenerated with Python 3.13 compatible dependencies

### No Breaking Changes
- No dependency version upgrades required
- No code changes required
- Existing CDK version (7.3.9) already supports Python 3.13
- All Google API client libraries compatible with Python 3.13

### Test Results Summary
