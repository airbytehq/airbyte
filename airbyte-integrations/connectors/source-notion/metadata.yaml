      3.0.0:
        message:
          The source Notion connector is being migrated from the Python CDK
          to our declarative low-code CDK. Due to changes in the handling of state
          format between these CDKs, this migration constitutes a breaking change
          for users syncing the `Comments` stream. To ensure a smooth migration, please
          reset your data for this stream upon updating. This will facilitate a fresh
          first sync. If you are not syncing the `Comments` stream, you can upgrade
          without any further action. For more information, see our migration documentation
          for source Notion.

          to reflect updates to the Notion API. A full schema refresh and data reset
