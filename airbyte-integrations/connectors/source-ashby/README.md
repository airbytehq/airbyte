# Ashby Source

This is the repository for the Ashby configuration based source connector.
For information about how to use this connector within Airbyte, see [the documentation](https://docs.airbyte.io/integrations/sources/ashby).

## Local development

#### Create credentials
**If you are a community contributor**, follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://docs.airbyte.io/integrations/sources/ashby)
to generate the necessary credentials. Then create a file `secrets/config.json` conforming to the `source_ashby/spec.yaml` file.
Note that any directory named `secrets` is gitignored across the entire Airbyte repo, so there is no danger of accidentally checking in sensitive information.
See `integration_tests/sample_config.json` for a sample config file.

**If you are an Airbyte core member**, copy the credentials in Lastpass under the secret name `source ashby test creds`
and place them into `secrets/config.json`.

### Locally running the connector docker image


#### Build
**Via [`airbyte-ci`](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-ci/connectors/pipelines/README.md) (recommended):**
```bash
airbyte-ci connectors --name=source-ashby build
```

An image will be built with the tag `airbyte/source-ashby:dev`.

**Via `docker build`:**
```bash
docker build -t airbyte/source-ashby:dev .
```

#### Run
Then run any of the connector commands as follows:
```
docker run --rm airbyte/source-ashby:dev spec
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets airbyte/source-ashby:dev check --config /secrets/config.json
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets airbyte/source-ashby:dev discover --config /secrets/config.json
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets -v $(pwd)/integration_tests:/integration_tests airbyte/source-ashby:dev read --config /secrets/config.json --catalog /integration_tests/configured_catalog.json
```

## Testing
You can run our full test suite locally using [`airbyte-ci`](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-ci/connectors/pipelines/README.md):
```bash
airbyte-ci connectors --name=source-ashby test
```

### Customizing acceptance Tests
Customize `acceptance-test-config.yml` file to configure tests. See [Connector Acceptance Tests](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/testing-connectors/connector-acceptance-tests-reference) for more information.
If your connector requires to create or destroy resources for use during acceptance tests create fixtures for it and place them inside integration_tests/acceptance.py.

## Dependency Management
All of your dependencies should go in `setup.py`, NOT `requirements.txt`. The requirements file is only used to connect internal Airbyte dependencies in the monorepo for local development.
We split dependencies between two groups, dependencies that are:
* required for your connector to work need to go to `MAIN_REQUIREMENTS` list.
* required for the testing need to go to `TEST_REQUIREMENTS` list

### Publishing a new version of the connector
You've checked out the repo, implemented a million dollar feature, and you're ready to share your changes with the world. Now what?
1. Make sure your changes are passing our test suite: `airbyte-ci connectors --name=source-ashby test`
2. Bump the connector version in `metadata.yaml`: increment the `dockerImageTag` value. Please follow [semantic versioning for connectors](https://docs.airbyte.com/contributing-to-airbyte/resources/pull-requests-handbook/#semantic-versioning-for-connectors).
3. Make sure the `metadata.yaml` content is up to date.
4. Make the connector documentation and its changelog is up to date (`docs/integrations/sources/ashby.md`).
5. Create a Pull Request: use [our PR naming conventions](https://docs.airbyte.com/contributing-to-airbyte/resources/pull-requests-handbook/#pull-request-title-convention).
6. Pat yourself on the back for being an awesome contributor.
7. Someone from Airbyte will take a look at your PR and iterate with you to merge it into master.
