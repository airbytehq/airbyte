        TODO: Optionally override this method to define this stream's slices. If slicing is not needed, delete this method.

        Slices control when state is saved. Specifically, state is saved after a slice has been fully read.
        This is useful if the API offers reads by groups or filters, and can be paired with the state object to make reads efficient. See the "concepts"
        section of the docs for more information.

        The function is called before reading any records in a stream. It returns an Iterable of dicts, each containing the
        necessary data to craft a request for a slice. The stream state is usually referenced to determine what slices need to be created.
        This means that data in a slice is usually closely related to a stream's cursor_field and stream_state.

        An HTTP request is made for each returned slice. The same slice can be accessed in the path, request_params and request_header functions to help
        craft that specific request.

        For example, if https://example-api.com/v1/employees offers a date query params that returns data for that particular day, one way to implement
        this would be to consult the stream state object for the last synced date, then return a slice containing each date from the last synced date
        till now. The request_params function would then grab the date from the stream_slice and make it part of the request by injecting it into
        the date query param.
