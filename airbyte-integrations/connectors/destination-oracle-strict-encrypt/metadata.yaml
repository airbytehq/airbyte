        upgradeDeadline: "2024-05-01"
        message: >
          This version removes the option to use "normalization" with Oracle. It also changes
          the schema and database of Airbyte's "raw" tables to be compatible with the new
          [Destinations V2](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/upgrading_to_destinations_v2/#what-is-destinations-v2)
          format. These changes will likely require updates to downstream dbt / SQL models.
          Selecting `Upgrade` will upgrade **all** connections using this destination at their next sync.
