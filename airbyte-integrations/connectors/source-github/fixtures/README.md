# Create Template GitHub Repository

## Pre requirements
### 1. Create a repository on www.github.com
### 2. Create an api key https://github.com/settings/tokens (select all checkboxes, with all checkboxes script will have all privileges and will not fail)

---
### 1. Copy github-filler to another directory without any initialized repository
### 2. Then just run and enter credentials

## After all the steps, you will have a GitHub repository with data that covers almost all GitHub streams (in Airbyte connectors), but you will need to add some data manually.
    1. Collaborators (invite collaborators)
    2. Asignees (asignee issues to collaborators)
    3. Teams (create a teams inside organization)
## All of this data can be generated through the GitHub site.
