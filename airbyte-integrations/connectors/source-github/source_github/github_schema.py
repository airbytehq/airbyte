    zero or more file `deletions`.  Both fields are optional; omitting
    both will produce a commit with no file changes.  `deletions` and
    `additions` describe changes to files identified by their path in
    the git tree using unix-style path separators, i.e. `/`.  The root
    of a git tree is an empty string, so paths are not slash-prefixed.
    `path` values must be unique across all `additions` and
    `deletions` provided.  Any duplication will result in a validation
    error.  ### Encoding  File contents must be provided in full for
    each `FileAddition`.  The `contents` of a `FileAddition` must be
    encoded using RFC 4648 compliant base64, i.e. correct padding is
    required and no characters outside the standard alphabet may be
    used.  Invalid base64 encoding will be rejected with a validation
    error.  The encoded contents may be binary.  For text files, no
    assumptions are made about the character encoding of the file
    contents (after base64 decoding).  No charset transcoding or line-
    ending normalization will be performed; it is the client's
    responsibility to manage the character encoding of files they
    provide. However, for maximum compatibility we recommend using
    UTF-8 encoding and ensuring that all files in a repository use a
    consistent line-ending convention (`\n` or `\r\n`), and that all
    files end with a newline.  ### Modeling file changes  Each of the
    the five types of conceptual changes that can be made in a git
    commit can be described using the `FileChanges` type as follows:
    1. New file addition: create file `hello world\n` at path
    `docs/README.txt`:         {          "additions" [            {
    "path": "docs/README.txt",              "contents":
    base64encode("hello world\n")            }          ]        }  2.
    Existing file modification: change existing `docs/README.txt` to
    have new    content `new content here\n`:         {
    "additions" [            {              "path": "docs/README.txt",
    "contents": base64encode("new content here\n")            }
    ]        }  3. Existing file deletion: remove existing file
    `docs/README.txt`.    Note that the path is required to exist --
    specifying a    path that does not exist on the given branch will
    abort the    commit and return an error.         {
    "deletions" [            {              "path": "docs/README.txt"
    }          ]        }   4. File rename with no changes: rename
    `docs/README.txt` with    previous content `hello world\n` to the
    same content at    `newdocs/README.txt`:         {
    "deletions" [            {              "path": "docs/README.txt",

    base64encode("hello world\n")            }          ]        }
    5. File rename with changes: rename `docs/README.txt` with
    previous content `hello world\n` to a file at path
    `newdocs/README.txt` with content `new contents\n`:         {
    "deletions" [            {              "path": "docs/README.txt",

    This mutation creates a commit whose parent is the HEAD of the
    provided branch and also updates that branch to point to the new
    commit. It can be thought of as similar to `git commit`.  ###
    Locating a Branch  Commits are appended to a `branch` of type
    `Ref`. This must refer to a git branch (i.e.  the fully qualified
    path must begin with `refs/heads/`, although including this prefix
    is optional.  Callers may specify the `branch` to commit to either
    by its global node ID or by passing both of
    `repositoryNameWithOwner` and `refName`.  For more details see the
    documentation for `CommittableBranch`.  ### Describing Changes
    `fileChanges` are specified as a `FilesChanges` object describing
    `FileAdditions` and `FileDeletions`.  Please see the documentation
    for `FileChanges` for more information on how to use this argument
    to describe any set of file changes.  ### Authorship  Similar to
    the web commit interface, this mutation does not support
    specifying the author or committer of the commit and will not add
    support for this in the future.  A commit created by a successful
    execution of this mutation will be authored by the owner of the
    credential which authenticates the API request.  The committer
    will be identical to that of commits authored using the web
    interface.  If you need full control over author and committer
    information, please use the Git Database REST API instead.  ###
    Commit Signing  Commits made using this mutation are automatically
    signed by GitHub if supported and will be marked as verified in
    the user interface.
