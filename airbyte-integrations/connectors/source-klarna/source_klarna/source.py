TODO: Most comments in this class are instructive and should be deleted after the source is implemented.

This file provides a stubbed example of how to use the Airbyte CDK to develop both a source connector which supports full refresh or and an
incremental syncs from an HTTP API.

The various TODOs are both implementation hints and steps - fulfilling all the TODOs should be sufficient to implement one basic and one incremental
stream from a source. This pattern is the same one used by Airbyte internally to implement connectors.

The approach here is not authoritative, and devs are free to use their own judgement.

There are additional required TODOs in the files within the integration_tests folder and the spec.yaml file.

# Basic full refresh stream
class KlarnaStream(HttpStream, ABC):
    """
    TODO remove this comment

    This class represents a stream output by the connector.
    This is an abstract base class meant to contain all the common functionality at the API level e.g: the API base URL, pagination strategy,
    parsing responses etc..

    Each stream should extend this class (or another abstract subclass of it) to specify behavior unique to that stream.

    Typically for REST APIs each stream corresponds to a resource in the API. For example if the API
    contains the endpoints
        - GET v1/customers
        - GET v1/employees

    then you should have three classes:
    `class KlarnaStream(HttpStream, ABC)` which is the current class
    `class Customers(KlarnaStream)` contains behavior to pull data for customers using v1/customers
    `class Employees(KlarnaStream)` contains behavior to pull data for employees using v1/employees

    If some streams implement incremental sync, it is typical to create another class
    `class IncrementalKlarnaStream((KlarnaStream), ABC)` then have concrete stream implementations extend it. An example
    is provided below.

    See the reference docs for the full list of configurable options.

        Slices control when state is saved. Specifically, state is saved after a slice has been fully read.
        This is useful if the API offers reads by groups or filters, and can be paired with the state object to make reads efficient. See the "concepts"
        section of the docs for more information.

        The function is called before reading any records in a stream. It returns an Iterable of dicts, each containing the
        necessary data to craft a request for a slice. The stream state is usually referenced to determine what slices need to be created.
        This means that data in a slice is usually closely related to a stream's cursor_field and stream_state.

        An HTTP request is made for each returned slice. The same slice can be accessed in the path, request_params and request_header functions to help
        craft that specific request.

        For example, if https://example-api.com/v1/employees offers a date query params that returns data for that particular day, one way to implement
        this would be to consult the stream state object for the last synced date, then return a slice containing each date from the last synced date
        till now. The request_params function would then grab the date from the stream_slice and make it part of the request by injecting it into
        the date query param.
