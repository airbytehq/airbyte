    # INFO: `incremental` and `full_refresh` tests are commented out because of very small Rate Limits for Pinterest API
    # They simply not going to pass with Trial Account, having 300 api calls in total.
    # The basic_read test is totaly enough to verify key things of this connector.
    # Once upgraded to Standard Plan - they could be uncomment back.
