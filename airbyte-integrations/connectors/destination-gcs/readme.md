# Destination Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

In order to test the GCS destination, you need a Google Cloud Platform account.

You need to generate the HMAC Keys for a service account then use them as keys to connect.
Obviously you also need to provide the right grants to the user in order to allow it to create and delete buckets and files in GCS.
