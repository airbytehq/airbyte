"""
This module is used for pulling the contents of "collections" out of Webflow, which is a CMS for hosting websites.
A Webflow collection may be a group of items such as "Blog Posts", "Blog Authors", etc.
There may be many collections, each of which can have its own distinct schema. This module will dynamically figure out
which collections are available, and will dynamically create the schema for each collection based on information
extracted from Webflow. It will then download all of the items from all of the selected collections.

Because the amount of data is expected to be "small" (not TB of data), we have not implemented any kind of
incremental downloading of data from Webflow. Each time this code is exectued, it will pull back all of the items
that are contained in each of the desired collections.
