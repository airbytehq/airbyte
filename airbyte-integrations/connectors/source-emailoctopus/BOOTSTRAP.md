# EmailOctopus

EmailOctopus is an email marketing tool. Link to API [here](https://emailoctopus.com/api-documentation).

## How to get an API key
- [Sign up for EmailOctopus](https://emailoctopus.com/account/sign-up). I recall there is a verification process that involves speaking with support staff.
- Pricing is volume-based, so a sandbox account should be free: see [Pricing](https://emailoctopus.com/pricing).
- Once signed in, generate an API key from the [API documentation page](https://emailoctopus.com/api-documentation).
