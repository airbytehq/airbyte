The LinkedIn Marketing Developer Platform API can be used to pull data from LinkedIn Organizations such as company page details, follower counts, follower statistics, and all sorts of organic content data.

You must have a LinkedIn Developers' App created in order to request access to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/">Marketing Developer Platform API</a>. API Access approval takes up to 72 hours after submitting a ~15-question form.

The app also must be verified by an admin of the LinkedIn organization your app is created for. Once the app is "verified" and granted access to the Marketing Developer Platform API, you can use their easy-peasy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/developers/tools/oauth">OAuth Token Tools</a> to generate access tokens **and** refresh tokens.

You can access the `client id` and `client secret` in the **Auth** tab of the app dashboard to round out all of the authorization needs you may have.
