/**
 * The record iterator is the consumer (in the producer / consumer relationship with debezium)
 * responsible for 1. making sure every record produced by the record publisher is processed 2.
 * signalling to the record publisher when it is time for it to stop producing records. It emits
 * this signal either when the publisher had not produced a new record for a long time or when it
 * has processed at least all of the records that were present in the database when the source was
 * started. Because the publisher might publish more records between the consumer sending this
 * signal and the publisher actually shutting down, the consumer must stay alive as long as the
 * publisher is not closed. Even after the publisher is closed, the consumer will finish processing
 * any produced records before closing.

  /**
   * Debezium was built as an ever running process which keeps on listening for new changes on DB and
   * immediately processing them. Airbyte needs debezium to work as a start stop mechanism. In order
   * to determine when to stop debezium engine we rely on few factors 1. TargetPosition logic. At the
   * beginning of the sync we define a target position in the logs of the DB. This can be an LSN or
   * anything specific to the DB which can help us identify that we have reached a specific position
   * in the log based replication When we start processing records from debezium, we extract the the
   * log position from the metadata of the record and compare it with our target that we defined at
   * the beginning of the sync. If we have reached the target position, we shutdown the debezium
   * engine 2. The TargetPosition logic might not always work and in order to tackle that we have
   * another logic where if we do not receive records from debezium for a given duration, we ask
   * debezium engine to shutdown 3. We also take the Snapshot into consideration, when a connector is
   * running for the first time, we let it complete the snapshot and only after the completion of
   * snapshot we should shutdown the engine. If we are closing the engine before completion of
   * snapshot, we throw an exception
