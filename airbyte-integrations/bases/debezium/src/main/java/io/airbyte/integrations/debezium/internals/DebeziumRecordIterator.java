/**
 * The record iterator is the consumer (in the producer / consumer relationship with debezium)
 * responsible for 1. making sure every record produced by the record publisher is processed 2.
 * signalling to the record publisher when it is time for it to stop producing records. It emits
 * this signal either when the publisher had not produced a new record for a long time or when it
 * has processed at least all of the records that were present in the database when the source was
 * started. Because the publisher might publish more records between the consumer sending this
 * signal and the publisher actually shutting down, the consumer must stay alive as long as the
 * publisher is not closed. Even after the publisher is closed, the consumer will finish processing
 * any produced records before closing.
