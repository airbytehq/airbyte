### WARNING ###
# The Java connector Dockerfiles will soon be deprecated.
# This Dockerfile is not used to build the connector image we publish to DockerHub.
# The new logic to build the connector image is declared with Dagger here:
# https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/tools/ci_connector_ops/ci_connector_ops/pipelines/actions/environments.py#L649

# If you need to add a custom logic to build your connector image, you can do it by adding a finalize_build.sh or finalize_build.py script in the connector folder.
# Please reach out to the Connectors Operations team if you have any question.
