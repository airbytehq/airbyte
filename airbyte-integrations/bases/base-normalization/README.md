# Testing normalization

Below are short descriptions of the kind of tests that may be affected by changes to the normalization code.

### Build & Activate Virtual Environment and install dependencies
From this connector directory, create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

This will generate a virtualenv for this module in `.venv/`. Make sure this venv is active in your
development environment of choice. To activate it from the terminal, run:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you are in an IDE, follow your IDE's instructions to activate the virtualenv.

Note that while we are installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`, you should only edit `setup.py` for your dependencies. `requirements.txt` is
used for editable installs (`pip install -e`) to pull in Python dependencies from the monorepo and will call `setup.py`.
If this is mumbo jumbo to you, don't worry about it, just put your deps in `setup.py` but install using `pip install -r requirements.txt` and everything
should work as you expect.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are automatically included when building the normalization project.
But you could invoke them explicitly by running the following commands for example:

with Gradle:

    ./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:bases:base-normalization:unitTest

or directly with pytest:

    pytest airbyte-integrations/bases/base-normalization/unit_tests

Unit tests are targeted at the main code generation functionality of normalization.
They should verify different logic rules on how to convert an input catalog.json (JSON Schema) file into
dbt files.

#### test_transform_config.py:

This class is testing the transform config functionality that converts a destination_config.json into the adequate profiles.yml file for dbt to use
see [related dbt docs on profiles.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/profiles.yml) for more context on what it actually is.

#### test_stream_processor.py and test_table_name_registry.py:

These unit tests functions check how each stream is converted to dbt models files.
For example, one big focus area is around how table names are chosen.
(especially since some destination like postgres have a very low limit to identifiers length of 64 characters)
In case of nested objects/arrays in a stream, names can be dragged on to even longer names...

So you can find rules of how to truncate and concatenate part of the table names together in here.
Depending on the catalog context and what identifiers have been already used in the past, some naming
may also be affected and requires to choose new identifications to avoid collisions.

Additional helper functions dealing with cursor fields, primary keys and other code generation parts are also being tested here.

#### test_destination_name_transformer.py:

These Unit tests checks implementation of specific rules of SQL identifier naming conventions for each destination.
The specifications rules of each destinations are detailed in the corresponding docs, especially on the
allowed characters, if quotes are needed or not, and the length limitations:

- [bigquery](../../../docs/integrations/destinations/bigquery.md)
- [postgres](../../../docs/integrations/destinations/postgres.md)
- [redshift](../../../docs/integrations/destinations/redshift.md)
- [snowflake](../../../docs/integrations/destinations/snowflake.md)
- [mysql](../../../docs/integrations/destinations/mysql.md)
- [oracle](../../../docs/integrations/destinations/oracle.md)
- [mssql](../../../docs/integrations/destinations/mssql.md)

Rules about truncations, for example for both of these strings which are too long for the postgres 64 limit:
- `Aaaa_Bbbb_Cccc_Dddd_Eeee_Ffff_Gggg_Hhhh_Iiii`
- `Aaaa_Bbbb_Cccc_Dddd_a_very_long_name_Ffff_Gggg_Hhhh_Iiii`

Deciding on how to truncate (in the middle) are being verified in these tests.
In this instance, both strings ends up as:

- `Aaaa_Bbbb_Cccc_Dddd___e_Ffff_Gggg_Hhhh_Iiii`

The truncate operation gets rid of characters in the middle of the string to preserve the start
and end characters as it may contain more useful information in table naming. However the final
truncated name can still potentially cause collisions in table names...

Note that dealing with such collisions is not part of `destination_name_transformer` but of the
`stream_processor` since one is focused on destination conventions and the other on putting together
identifier names from streams and catalogs.

## Integration Tests

With Gradle:

    ./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:bases:base-normalization:integrationTest

or directly with pytest:

    pytest airbyte-integrations/bases/base-normalization/integration_tests

or can also be invoked on github, thanks to the slash commands posted as comments:

    /test connector=bases/base-normalization

You can restrict the tests to a subset of destinations by specifying a comma separated list of destinations.
For example, let's say you are working on a change to normalization for Postgres, with Gradle:

    NORMALIZATION_TEST_TARGET=postgres ./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:bases:base-normalization:integrationTest

or directly with pytest:

    NORMALIZATION_TEST_TARGET=postgres  pytest airbyte-integrations/bases/base-normalization/integration_tests

Note that these tests are connecting and processing data on top of real data warehouse destinations.
Therefore, valid credentials files are expected to be injected in the `secrets/` folder in order to run
(not included in git repository).

This is usually automatically done by the CI thanks to the `tools/bin/ci_credentials.sh` script or you can 
re-use the `destination_config.json` passed to destination connectors.

As normalization supports more and more destinations, tests are relying on an increasing number of destinations. 
As a result, it is possible that the docker garbage collector is triggered to wipe "unused" docker images while the 
integration tests for normalization are running. Thus, if you encounter errors about a connector's docker image not being 
present locally (even though it was built beforehand), make sure to increase the docker image storage size of your docker engine ("defaultKeepStorage" for mac for example).

### Integration Tests Definitions for test_ephemeral.py:
The test here focus on benchmarking the "ephemeral" materialization mode of dbt. Depending on the number of
columns in a catalog, this may throw exceptions and fail. This test ensures that we support reasonable number of columns in destination tables.

For example, known limitations that are now supported were:
- Ephemeral materialization with some generated models break with more than 490 columns with "maximum recursion depth exceeded", we now automatically switch to a little more scalable mode when generating dbt models by using views materialization.
- The tests are currently checking that at least a reasonably large number (1500) of columns can complete successfully.

However, limits on the destination still exists and can break for higher number of columns...

### Integration Tests Definitions for test_normalization.py:

Some test suites can be selected to be versioned control in Airbyte git repository (or not).
This is useful to see direct impacts of code changes on downstream files generated or compiled
by normalization and dbt (directly in PR too). (_Simply refer to your test suite name in the
`git_versioned_tests` variable in the `base-normalization/integration_tests/test_normalization.py` file_)

We would typically choose small and meaningful test suites to include in git while others more complex tests
can be left out. They would still be run in a temporary directory and thrown away at the end of the tests.

They are defined, each one of them, in a separate directory in the resource folder.
For example, below, we would have 2 different tests "suites" with this hierarchy:

      base-normalization/integration_tests/resources/
      ├── test_suite1/
      │   ├── data_input/
      │   │   ├── catalog.json
      │   │   ├── messages.txt
      │   │   └── replace_identifiers.json
      │   ├── dbt_data_tests/
      │   │   ├── file1.sql
      │   │   └── file2.sql
      │   ├── dbt_schema_tests/
      │   │   ├── file1.yml
      │   │   └── file2.yml
      │   └── README.md
      └── test_suite2/
          ├── data_input/
          │   ├── catalog.json
          │   └── messages.txt
          ├── dbt_data_tests/
          ├── dbt_schema_tests/
          └── README.md

#### README.md:

Each test suite should have an optional `README.md` to include further details and descriptions of what the test is trying to verify and
how it is specifically built.

### Integration Test Data Input:

#### data_input/catalog.json:

The `catalog.json` is the main input for normalization from which the dbt models files are being
generated from as it describes in JSON Schema format what the data structure is.

#### data_input/messages.txt:

The `messages.txt` are serialized Airbyte JSON records that should be sent to the destination as if they were
transmitted by a source. In this integration test, the files is read and "cat" through to the docker image of
each destination connectors to populate `_airbyte_raw_tables`. These tables are finally used as input
data for dbt to run from.

#### data_input/replace_identifiers.json:
The `replace_identifiers.json` contains maps of string patterns and values to replace in the `dbt_schema_tests`
and `dbt_data_tests` files to handle cross database compatibility.

Note that an additional step is added before replacing identifiers to change capitalization of identifiers in those
tests files. (to uppercase on snowflake and lowercase on redshift).

### Integration Test Execution Flow:

These integration tests are run against all destinations that dbt can be executed on.
So, for each target destination, the steps run by the tests are:

1. Prepare the test execution workspace folder (copy skeleton from `dbt-project-template/`)
2. Generate a dbt `profiles.yml` file to connect to the target destination
3. Populate raw tables by running the target destination connectors, reading and uploading the
   `messages.txt` file as data input.
4. Run Normalization step to generate dbt models files from `catalog.json` input file.
5. Execute dbt cli command: `dbt run` from the test workspace folder to compile generated models files
   - from `models/generated/` folder
   - into `../build/(compiled|run)/airbyte_utils/models/generated/` folder
   - The final "run" SQL files are also copied (for archiving) to `final/` folder by the test script.
6. Deploy the `schema_tests` and `data_tests` files into the test workspace folder.
7. Execute dbt cli command: `dbt tests` from the test workspace folder to run verifications and checks with dbt.
8. Optional checks (nothing for the moment)

Note that the tests are using the normalization code from the python files directly, so it is not necessary to rebuild the docker images
in between when iterating on the code base. However, dbt cli and destination connectors are invoked thanks to the dev docker images.

### Integration Test Checks:

#### dbt schema tests:

dbt allows out of the box to configure some tests as properties for an existing model (or source, seed, or snapshot).
This can be done in yaml format as described in the following documentation pages:

- [dbt schema-tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests#schema-tests)
- [custom schema test](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/writing-custom-schema-tests)
- [dbt expectations](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-expectations)

We are leveraging these capabilities in these integration tests to verify some relationships in our
generated tables on the destinations.

#### dbt data tests:

Additionally, dbt also supports "data tests" which are specified as SQL queries.
A data test is a select statement that returns 0 records when the test is successful.

- [dbt data-tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests#data-tests)

#### Notes using dbt seeds:

Because some functionalities are not stable enough on dbt side, it is difficult to properly use
`dbt seed` commands to populate a set of expected data tables at the moment. Hopefully, this can be
more easily be done in the future...

Related issues to watch on dbt progress to improve this aspects:
- https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2959#issuecomment-747509782
- https://medium.com/hashmapinc/unit-testing-on-dbt-models-using-a-static-test-dataset-in-snowflake-dfd35549b5e2

A nice improvement would be to add csv/json seed files as expected output data from tables.
The integration tests would verify that the content of such tables in the destination would match
these seed files or fail.

### Debug dbt operations with local database
This only works for testing databases launched in local containers (e.g. postgres and mysql).

- In `dbt_integration_test.py`, comment out the `tear_down_db` method so that the relevant database container is not deleted.
- Find the name of the database container in the logs (e.g. by searching `Executing`).
- Connect to the container by running `docker exec -it <container-name> bash` in the commandline.
- Connect to the database inside the container (e.g. `mysql -u root` for mysql).
- Test the generated dbt operations directly in the database.

## Standard Destination Tests

Generally, to invoke standard destination tests, you run with gradle using:

    ./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:connectors:destination-<connector name>:integrationTest

For more details and options, you can also refer to the [testing connectors docs](../../../docs/connector-development/testing-connectors/README.md).

## Acceptance Tests

Please refer to the [developing docs](../../../docs/contributing-to-airbyte/developing-locally.md) on how to run Acceptance Tests.
