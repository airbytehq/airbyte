# Commonly, it's helpful to define multiple targets for a profile. For example,
# these targets might be `dev` and `prod`. Whereas the `dev` target points to
# a development schema (eg. dbt_dev), the `prod` schema should point to the
# prod schema (eg. analytics). Analytical/BI tools should point to the
# prod schema so that local development does not interfere with analysis.
#

dev:
    target: dev                   # default target is dev unless changed at run time
    outputs:
        dev:
