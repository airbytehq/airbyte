   * This pipeline is based on DestinationConsumers that can interact with some kind of Sql based

   * The Strategy used here is:
   * <p>
   * 1. Create a temporary table for each stream
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * 2. Accumulate records in a buffer. One buffer per stream.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * 3. As records accumulate write them in batch to the database. We set a minimum numbers of records
   * before writing to avoid wasteful record-wise writes.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * 4. Once all records have been written to buffer, flush the buffer and write any remaining records
   * to the database (regardless of how few are left).
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * 5. In a single transaction, delete the target tables if they exist and rename the temp tables to
   * the final table name.
   * </p>
   *
   * @param destination is a destination based on Sql engine which provides certain SQL Queries to
   *        interact with
   * @param namingResolver is a SQLNamingResolvable object to translate strings into valid identifiers
   *        supported by the underlying Sql Database
   * @param config the destination configuration object
   * @param catalog describing the streams of messages to write to the destination
   * @return A DestinationConsumer able to accept the Airbyte Messages
