   * Iterates over streams until it finds one that is ready to flush. Streams are ordered by priority.
   * Return an empty optional if no streams are ready.
   * <p>
   * A stream is ready to flush if it either meets a size threshold or a time threshold. For the size
   * threshold, the size of the data in the queue is compared to the threshold that is passed into
   * this method.
   * <p>
   * One caveat, is that if that stream already has a worker running, we "penalize" its size. We do
   * this by computing what the size of the queue would be after the running workers for that queue
   * complete. This is based on a dumb estimate of how much data a worker can process. There is an
   * opportunity for optimization here, by being smarter about predicting how much data a running
   * worker is likely to process.
   * <p>
   * Finally, the time trigger is based on the last time a record was added to the queue. We don't
   * want records to sit forever, even if the queue is not that full (bad for time to value for
   * users). Also, the more time passes since a record was added, the less likely another record is
   * coming (caveat is CDC where it's random).

   * @param queueSizeThresholdBytes - the size threshold to use for determining if a stream is ready
   *        to flush.
