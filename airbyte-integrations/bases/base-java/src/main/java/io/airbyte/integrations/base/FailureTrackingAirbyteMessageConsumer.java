/**
 * Minimal abstract class intended to provide a consistent structure to classes seeking to implement
 * the {@link AirbyteMessageConsumer} interface. The original interface methods are wrapped in
 * generic exception handlers - any exception is caught and logged.
 *
 * Two methods are intended for extension: - startTracked: Wraps set up of necessary
 * infrastructure/configuration before message consumption. - acceptTracked: Wraps actual processing
 * of each {@link io.airbyte.protocol.models.AirbyteMessage}.
 *
 * Though not necessary, we highly encourage using this class when implementing destinations. See
 * child classes for examples.
