## What
A `test_strictness_level` field was introduced to Connector Acceptance Tests.
{{ connector_name }} is a {{ release_stage }} connector, we want it to have a `high` test strictness level.

**This will help**:
- maximize the acceptance test coverage on this connector.
- document its potential weaknesses in term of test coverage.

## How
1. Migrate the existing `acceptance-test-config.yml` file to the latest configuration format. (See instructions [here](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/bases/connector-acceptance-test/README.md#L61))
2. Enable `high` test strictness level in `acceptance-test-config.yml`. (See instructions [here](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/docs/connector-development/testing-connectors/connector-acceptance-tests-reference.md#L240))
3. Commit changes on `acceptance-test-config.yml` and open a PR.
4. Run the tests with the `/test` command on the branch.
5. If tests are failing please fix the failing test or use `bypass_reason` fields to explain why a specific test can't be run.
