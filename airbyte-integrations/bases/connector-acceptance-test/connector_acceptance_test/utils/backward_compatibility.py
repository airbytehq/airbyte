    This function traverses a JSON schema and removes the 'format' field for properties

    The 'pattern' is often more restrictive than the 'date-time' format, and Hypothesis can't natively generate
    date-times that match a specific pattern. Therefore, in this case, we've opted to
    remove the 'date-time' format since the 'pattern' is more restrictive and more likely
    to cause a breaking change if not adhered to.

    On the otherside we also validate the output of hypothesis against the new schema to ensure
    that the generated data matches the new schema. In this case we will catch whether or not the
    date-time format is still being adhered to.
