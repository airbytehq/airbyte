# New generic source checklist

This is an autogenerated file describing the steps needed to implement a new Airbyte source.

- Make sure you've read the [Airbyte Specification documentation](https://docs.airbyte.io/architecture/airbyte-specification)
- Iterate on your connector locally in your language of choice until it works as intended
- Edit the Dockerfile so the image it produces contains your connector and conforms to the Airbyte Protocol
- Once your image is working, make sure your connector passes the standard Airbyte test suite by running
  `./gradlew :airbyte-integrations:connectors:source-{{snakeCase name}}:standardSourceTestFile`. See
  [Testing Connectors](https://docs.airbyte.io/connector-development/testing-connectors) for more information about
  standard tests.
- If API credentials are required to run the integration, please document how they can be obtained or link to a how-to guide.

At any point during this process, feel free to create a PR against the Airbyte Repo and ask for any support or questions. We're always here to help!
