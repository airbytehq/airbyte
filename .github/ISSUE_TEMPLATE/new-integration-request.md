## Tell us about the new connector you’d like to have
* Which source and which destination?
* Do you need a specific version of the underlying data source e.g: you specifically need support for an older version of the API or DB? 

## Describe the context around this new connector
* Why do you need this integration? How does your team intend to use the data? This helps us understand the use case.
* How often do you want to run syncs?
* If this is an API source connector, which entities/endpoints do you need supported?
* If the connector is for a paid service, can we name you as a mutual user when we subscribe for an account? Which company should we name? 

## Describe the alternative you are considering or using
What are you considering doing if you don’t have this integration through Airbyte?

## Are you willing to submit a PR?
<!--- 
We accept and love contributions! 
We just released the Airbyte Python Connector Development Framework (CDK), 
which helps simplify the process of building a new source connector. 
If you are even somewhat familiar with Python, this can be a good way to 
help us add a new connector! You can check out the #connector-development 
Slack channel to get more information about building a connector or to receive
help during the process!

Don't feel pressured in any way.
We understand if you can't submit a PR and we're tremendously grateful
that you've already contributed by suggesting a new integration.
