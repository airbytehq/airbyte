| Changelog | ⚠<br/>doc not found | The connector does not seem to have a documentation file. This can be normal (e.g. basic connector like `source-jdbc` is not published or documented). Please double-check to make sure that it is not a bug. |
| | ❌<br/>changelog missing | There is no chnagelog for the current version of the connector. If you are the author of the current version, please add a changelog. |
| Publish | ⚠<br/>not in seed | The connector is not in the [cloud](https://connectors.airbyte.com/files/registries/v0/cloud_registry.json) or [oss](https://connectors.airbyte.com/files/registries/v0/oss_registry.json) registry, so its publication status cannot be checked. This can be normal (e.g. some connectors are cloud-specific, and only listed in the cloud seed file). Please double-check to make sure that you have added a metadata.yaml file and the expected registries are enabled. |
