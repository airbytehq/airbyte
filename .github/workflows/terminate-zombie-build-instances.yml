# Required since we cannot guarantee instances are always terminated.
# Also a failsafe against a dev writing a workflow that does not terminate build instances.
# Though the average Airbyte build runtime as of this commit is ~20 mins, connector builds
# can take up to 3 hours. Set this to 3 hours to include these longer runs.
