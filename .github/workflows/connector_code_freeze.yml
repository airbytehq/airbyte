# This workflow is meant to be used to prevent/discourage merging to master during code freeze.
# The code freeze dates are set in the env variables CODE_FREEZE_START_DATE and CODE_FREEZE_END_DATE.
# If any connector code has been changed we display a warning message reminding merging is blocked and who to contact.
# If no connector connector code has been changed we only display a warning message reminding merging is discouraged.
# The Code freeze check job will be set as a required check for PRs in branch protection rules.
