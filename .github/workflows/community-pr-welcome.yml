name: Community PR Welcome Message

# This workflow automatically adds a welcome message to PRs from community contributors (forks)
# It includes a link to the local connector development documentation and other helpful resources
#
# MANUAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
# To manually test this workflow without a real fork PR:
# 1. Temporarily comment out the fork condition in the "Create comment" step
# 2. Add the "synchronize" event type to the workflow trigger
# 3. Push a change to trigger the workflow
# 4. Check that the welcome message appears in the PR with the correct repository name
# 5. After testing, restore the fork condition and remove "synchronize" from event types
# 6. The workflow should only run on PRs from forks with type "opened" in production
