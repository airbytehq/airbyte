name: Community PR Welcome Message

# This workflow automatically adds a welcome message to PRs from community contributors (forks)
# It includes a link to the local connector development documentation and other helpful resources
#
# MANUAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
# To manually test this workflow without a real fork PR, temporarily comment-out the fork condition in the
# `if:` clause and uncomment the "synchronize" event type as a workflow trigger.
# Then the workflow will run for all new commits.
#
# Before merging, remember to again comment-out the "synchronize" clause and uncomment the `if:` condition.
