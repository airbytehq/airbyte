          # Notes regarding static-args:
          # - Slash commands can be invoked from both issues and comments.
          # - If the slash command is invoked from an issue, we intentionally pass 'null' as the PR number.
          # - Comment ID will always be sent, and this is sufficient to post back status updates to the originating comment.
