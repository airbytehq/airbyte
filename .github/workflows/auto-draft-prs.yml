name: Auto-Draft PRs

# This workflow automatically converts new PRs to draft status.
# Rationale: Making a PR "ready for review" should be a conscious decision.
# Authors can easily mark their PR as ready when appropriate.
#
# Opt-out: Include "[ready]" in the PR title to skip auto-draft conversion.

            This PR has been automatically converted to **draft** status.

            When you're ready for review, click "Ready for review" at the bottom of the PR page.

            To skip this auto-draft behavior in the future, include `[ready]` in your PR title.
