concurrency:
  # This is the name of the concurrency group. It is used to prevent concurrent runs of the same workflow.
  #
  # - github.head_ref is only defined on PR runs, it makes sure that the concurrency group is unique for pull requests
  #  ensuring that only one run per pull request is active at a time.
  #
  # - github.run_id is defined on all runs, it makes sure that the concurrency group is unique for workflow dispatches.
  # This allows us to run multiple workflow dispatches in parallel.
