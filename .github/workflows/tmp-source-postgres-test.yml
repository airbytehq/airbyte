# This workflows runs airbyte-ci connectors --name=source-postgres test
# We created this in the context of our project to improve CI performances for this connector
# It's made to be triggered manually from the GitHub UI
# It will allow us to collect performance metrics outside of the context of nightly builds
# And also to use different runner types (e.g. conn-prod-xxlarge-runner) to test the connector with various resources.
