### Tips for Working with CI

1. **"Vercel" CI failures.** You can always ignore these. These are our docs builds but they can only be run by approval. A maintainer will approve the workflow upon request, but this failure should not be of concern.
2. **Pre-Release Checks.** Please pay attention to these, as they contain standard checks on the metadata.yaml file, docs requirements, etc. If you need help resolving a pre-release check, please ask a maintainer.
   - Note: If you are creating a new connector, please be sure to replace the default `logo.svg` file with a suitable icon.
3. **Connector CI Tests.** Some failures here may be expected if your tests require credentials. Please review these results to ensure (1) unit tests are passing, if applicable, and (2) integration tests pass to the degree possible and expected.
4. **(Optional.) [BYO Connector Credentials](https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/connector-development/local-connector-development#managing-connector-secrets) for tests in your fork.** You can _optionally_ set up your fork with BYO credentials for your connector. This can significantly speed up your review, ensuring your changes are fully tested before the maintainers begin their review.
